The jury then took a week off before returning Monday.</p> <p>A federal appeals court ordered a re-trial of Doody, who was convicted in 1993 and sentenced to 281 years in prison, after concluding he was not properly advised of his rights.</p> <p>The retrial rests heavily on whether jurors believe the account of accomplice Alex Garcia, who pleaded guilty and is serving 271 years in prison in exchange for avoiding a potential death sentence.</p> <p>Prosecutors argued that Johnathan Doody, then 17, and Garcia carefully planned the murders and robberies so that Doody could buy a Ford Mustang.</p> <p>Garcia was a key witness against Doody because little else links Doody to the slayings. During closing arguments, defense attorney Maria Schaffer painted Garcia as a master manipulator and called him the devil, saying there would be no case against Doody without Garcias testimony.</p> <p>But prosecutor Jason Kalish said Garcia has never wavered from his testimony in 22 years.</p> <p>Everything he said was corroborated, Kalish said. He made a deal to tell the truth. He was honoring his deal. He honors his word.</p> <p>Detectives linked Garcia to the slayings through a Marlin .22 rifle that Garcia had borrowed from a friend. Forensics identified the rifle as the murder weapon.</p> <p>But Garcia said it was Doody who used the gun and insisted there would be no witnesses to the robbery. Kalish said Garcia used a shotgun during the slayings. The victims were shot in the back of the head.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.836577"", ""count"": ""8"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Johnathan Doody""}, {""relevance"": ""0.675229"", ""count"": ""13"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Alex Garcia""}, {""relevance"": ""0.226996"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Jason Kalish""}, {""relevance"": ""0.173848"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""text"": ""Maricopa County Superior Court""}, {""relevance"": ""0.172791"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Facility"", ""text"": ""Wat Promkunaram temple""}, {""relevance"": ""0.150897"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Judge Joseph Kreamer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.130537"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Waddell""}, {""relevance"": ""0.126161"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Phoenix,_Maryland"", ""geonames"": ""http://sws.geonames.org/4365339/"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01yy7c"", ""subType"": [], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenix,_Maryland"", ""name"": ""Phoenix, Maryland""}, ""text"": ""Phoenix""}, {""relevance"": ""0.119234"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Crime"", ""text"": ""robbery""}, {""relevance"": ""0.117571"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""prosecutor""}, {""relevance"": ""0.117473"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Maria Schaffer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.116913"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Automobile"", ""text"": ""Mustang""}, {""relevance"": ""0.113442"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Crime"", ""text"": ""murder""}, {""relevance"": ""0.108605"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""attorney""}, {""relevance"": ""0.108605"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Quantity"", ""text"": ""271 years""}, {""relevance"": ""0.108605"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Quantity"", ""text"": ""281 years""}, {""relevance"": ""0.108605"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Quantity"", ""text"": ""22 years""}]","[{""relevance"": ""0.988353"", ""text"": ""Johnathan Doody""}, {""relevance"": ""0.843097"", ""text"": ""accomplice Alex Garcia""}, {""relevance"": ""0.747929"", ""text"": ""links Doody""}, {""relevance"": ""0.610044"", ""text"": ""Garcia\u2019s testimony""}, {""relevance"": ""0.582266"", ""text"": ""prosecutor Jason Kalish""}, {""relevance"": ""0.558997"", ""text"": ""Wat Promkunaram temple""}, {""relevance"": ""0.556112"", ""text"": ""Buddhist temple mass""}, {""relevance"": ""0.546559"", ""text"": ""Judge Joseph Kreamer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.531155"", ""text"": ""Maricopa County Superior""}, {""relevance"": ""0.509704"", ""text"": ""federal appeals court""}, {""relevance"": ""0.509484"", ""text"": ""potential death sentence""}, {""relevance"": ""0.504123"", ""text"": ""attorney Maria Schaffer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.365246"", ""text"": ""new jury""}, {""relevance"": ""0.331376"", ""text"": ""master manipulator""}, {""relevance"": ""0.328038"", ""text"": ""slayings""}, {""relevance"": ""0.311496"", ""text"": ""key witness""}, {""relevance"": ""0.309529"", ""text"": ""Ford Mustang""}, {""relevance"": ""0.29629"", ""text"": ""murder weapon""}, {""relevance"": ""0.245075"", ""text"": ""deliberations""}, {""relevance"": ""0.233212"", ""text"": ""jurors""}]"

Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p> <p>The Oregonian has been named a top target of the Club for Growth, which placed the eight-term Republican on a list of GOP members it is seeking to primary in 2014.</p> <p>A Club for Growth spokesman said the group had spoken with Linthicum over the phone, but has yet to have a formal meeting with him.</p> <p>We are watching the race, Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller said about whether the group is considering endorsing Linthicum in a primary.</p> <p>Linthicum spokeswoman Dani Nichols said Linthicum is still exploring a bid, and he will likely make a decision whether to run within the next two months.</p> <p>Within the next probably 30 to 60 days he will have gotten enough feedback to know whether or not this is the right decision for him and for the community, said Nichols, adding that Linthicum has been approached by many members of the community to run.</p> <p>Nichols said a Club for Growth endorsement would not make or break Linthicums decision to enter the contest.</p> <p>It is unclear how much of a threat Linthicum would be to Waldens future in the House. But a Walden aide expressed confidence in the congressmans re-election.</p> <p>No one works harder for Oregon families than Greg Walden, we are confident that voters will return Greg to Congress and support his efforts to repeal ObamaCare, and reduce the size and cost of government, said the Walden aide. Conservatives know he is leading the fight to grow our majority and ensure that President Obama never has total control of Washington again.</p> <p>The NRCC chairman has coasted to re-election seven times since was first elected in 1998. Hehad more than $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, a total he is poised to increase after the next fundraising deadline on Sept. 30.</p> <p>Oregons 2nd District is rated a Safe Republican contest by Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.

A Lions official declined comment.</p> <p>In a written statement provided to police, Ferrell said Suh cursed at him while pointing a gun upward and asked him to leave his property.</p> <p>Ferrell told police that Suh never pointed the gun directly at him. Police wrote in their report that he initially thought the gun ""looked like an AK-47.""</p> <p>Suh was not home when police responded to the call, but investigators interviewed him at the Lions' team hotel in Dearborn that night, according to the report.</p> <p>Clemence said Suh was cooperative when questioned at the hotel, and according to the report, Suh said he heard rustling in the trees behind his house after he returned home, ""picked up a pellet gun that was in his garage ... and looked through the scope towards the trees.""</p> <p>Suh told officers ""that he was 'in fear' for his and family members' safety daily and would always protect his family,"" according to the report.</p> <p>""If you think I show aggression on the football field, I would show more to protect my family,"" Suh told officers, according to the report.</p> <p>Suh had his sister, Ngum, turn the weapon, a green Gamo Varmint Hunter HP air rifle, over to police for the duration of their investigation. Birmingham police reviewed surveillance video with Ngum Suh on Aug. 20 at the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office.</p> <p>According to the report, the video showed Suh looking into his backyard after he arrived home. Ferrell then approached Suh, turned to show his reflective vest with ""Xfinity"" on the back, and the two communicated for a short period of time.</p> <p>""At no time in the video did Mr. Suh point the pellet gun at Mr. Ferrell in a threatening manner,"" the report said. ""The video shows the pellet gun in Suh's right hand pointing at the ground. After several minutes, Mr. Suh has it over his right shoulder, pointing away from Mr. Ferrell.""</p> <p>Suh was fined $100,000 by the NFL on Tuesday for an illegal block he delivered to Minnesota Vikings center John Sullivan, the sixth fine of his NFL career.</p> <p>He said today the fine is ""going through the appeals process,"" and he did not offer an opinion on its enormity.</p> <p>""You got to ask the league that question, whether they wanted to make a decision off my reputation or off of this year or whatever it may be,"" Suh said. ""It's the first game of the year, so I don't know.""</p> <p>Suh had several run-ins with police during his first three NFL seasons. Last year, Suh was ticketed twice, once for speeding after he was clocked doing 91 m.p.h. in 55-m.p.h. zone in his native Portland, Ore., and a second time for driving without due care and caution in Lathrup Village.</p> <p>Suh also was involved in a minor fender bender last fall in which neither driver was ticketed, a two-car accident in 2010 in which the driver of the other vehicle was ticketed, and in 2011, he crashed his 1970 Chevrolet Coupe into a tree, light pole and drinking fountain while serving a two-game suspension for stomping on the arm of Green Bay Packers lineman Evan

Gant, an African-American, went to Butlers apartment to discuss the ongoing racial comments.</p> <p>Upon arriving at the apartment, Butler shot Gant between the eyes with a .22 rifle and shut his door, leaving Gant to bleed outside.</p> <p>Butler called 911, finished cooking supper, sat down and began eating, the affidavit details. Nugent arrived on the scene and contacted Butler by phone, at which time Butler told Nugent to come in, that Butler was eating dinner and had put up the gun.</p> <p>Nugent said Butler acted as if inconvenienced when put under arrest, saying he could not understand the problem as he had only shot a (racial slur).</p> <p>Butler acknowledged shooting Gant.</p> <p>The incident fueled a community outpouring of support for Everett Gant and his family, an extended family with deep roots in the community. One of his great-uncles is Paul Gant of BBQ fame.</p> <p>The Lions Club of Port St. Joe immediately established and seeded an account at Centennial Bank to help the family defray medical costs.</p> <p>A Facebook page, Praying for Everett, was put up and a candlelight vigil that drew more than 100 people to Frank Pate Park was organized within days of the shooting.</p> <p>The outpouring from the community brought Everetts mother to the newspaper office several weeks ago.</p> <p>Gloria Gant, a popular teacher at Port St. Joe High School, said the community support was vital during such a trying time for the family.</p> <p>When people read about this they might think this is the most awful community, Gloria Gant said. But it is not. This is the warmest, most generous community and we cant thank everyone enough for their support.

www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/2912905,Melbourne,FL,"Parents, police seek answers in med student's slaying | FLORIDA TODAY | floridatoday.com",20131002T000000,"<p>DETROIT -- His small room was in the basement of the Phi Rho Sigma co-ed medical society house in Ann Arbor, near the workout room in a quieter and less trafficked part of the house.</p> <p>It's where Paul DeWolf, a 25-year-old medical student at the University of Michigan, lived while he worked toward an expected degree in the spring and a future as a doctor.</p> <p>It's also where he was found dead.</p> <p>A co-worker discovered DeWolf after checking on him at 11:30 a.m. July 24, when he failed to show up for work at the VA Hospital in Ann Arbor.</p> <p>More than two months later, police and his family still don't know who made their way into that basement apartment and shot DeWolf once in the neck. His death shocked many on the campus of more than 43,000 students and is the only homicide so far this year in Ann Arbor.</p> <p>His family and friends say they can't comprehend who would want DeWolf dead or why.</p> <p>""Obviously the question is: 'Why? Why did this happen?'"" said his father, Thom DeWolf.</p> <p>""And we may not get the answer to that one,"" said his mother, Kris DeWolf.</p> <p>""Or 'Who?'"" Thom DeWolf said. ""Paul didn't have enemies.""</p> <p>Police say they've executed numerous search warrants, conducted extensive interviews and administered polygraphs, but so far - despite a $10,000 reward being offered in the case - no one has been arrested for DeWolf's death.</p> <p>""We would definitely like to get this one solved,"" said Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Earle Fox.</p> <p>The DeWolfs, who spoke to the Free Press at their home in Schoolcraft, Mich., south of Kalamazoo, hope sharing their story will generate new tips.</p> <p>""I would hope that somebody would morally come forward and say something because they know that this is wrong,"" Thom DeWolf said.</p> <p>Who entered?</p> <p>There were no visible signs of forced entry to Paul DeWolf's room.</p> <p>The Phi Rho Sigma house, where a couple of dozen men and women who are attending medical school live, has shared space  and a front door and a back door, along with individual rooms that have locks on the doors.</p> <p>A day before DeWolf was discovered dead, a burglary was reported next door around 8:30 p.m., according to an online crime report and police. Police believe DeWolf was killed the night of July 23 or early on July 24.</p> <p>""We are looking into that,"" Fox said of the break-in.</p> <p>Fox declined to say whether there were any similarities between the two cases and wouldn't say whether anything was taken from DeWolf's room. Police said no firearm was found at the scene.</p> <p>Beyond those few details, police haven't released more information about their investigation, but say a team of detectives is pursuing leads.</p> <p>""These cases get solved a lot of times with public input,"" Fox said. ""And it could be something very minor, something they don't think is important. And a lot of times that little piece of information is what can turn the case.""</p> <p>Early interest in healing</p> <p>DeWolf's career goals were paved when he was just a kid.</p> <p>He'd play doctor, using a stethoscope to check on his older brother, Joshua DeWolf, when he was sick.</p> <p>Joshua DeWolf spent time in the hospital, paralyzed from a disorder that affects the nervous system, and Paul, then 11, got an up-close look as doctors treated him.</p> <p>It was a turning point in Paul DeWolf's life, prompting him to pursue a career in the medical field.</p> <p>""He wanted to do it all,"" said Thom DeWolf. ""And he had a lot to offer, so it's very sad that someone would end his life at a time when he was just beginning to peak.""</p> <p>Paul DeWolf, a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, had far-reaching goals: to serve his country, perform surgeries and take medical missions, his parents said.</p> <p>Friends and family describe DeWolf - the middle of three children - as smart, driven, competitive, loving, athletic and musical. Joining the Air Force allowed him to pay for medical school and focus on his studies, they said.</p> <p>DeWolf ran marathons, played volleyball, scuba dived and played several musical instruments, including the piano, French horn and more recently, the acoustic guitar. He began playing the piano when he was just 3 and started taking formal lessons in the second grade.</p> <p>""Music has always been a very integral part of our family,"" said Thom DeWolf, whose wife is a music teacher.</p> <p>Paul DeWolf shared that passion for the piano with Lindsey Gaston, a second-year medical student he once dated.</p> <p>""He had a brilliant musical ear and could pick up things really effortlessly,"" she recalled.</p> <p>When DeWolf's parents hear music at church,  the reality of their son being gone hits them the hardest.</p> <p>""Now when you start singing the songs, you filter them with a different set of lenses, and they take on a whole different set of meaning,"" Thom DeWolf said.</p> <p>""It's not so superficial anymore,"" Kris DeWolf said</p> <p>'We're all shattered'</p> <p>DeWolf's death leaves a void in the lives of many, including those who attended medical school with him.</p> <p>""We're all shattered over here,"" said Joe Duratinsky, one of DeWolf's closest friends and a fourth-year medical student. ""It seems like everyone has been affected - people that knew him really well, people that he only saw in passing in the hallways - everyone is devastated about it.""</p> <p>Duratinsky said it doesn't make sense.</p> <p>""I honestly do not have a good explanation, and that's one of the things that makes this so frustrating,"" he said.</p> <p>Gatson said she knows nothing will bring DeWolf back, but if someone comes forward, it will help his friends and family gain closure.</p> <p>""Ann Arbor is a pretty safe college town, and you just don't think that would happen to somebody, especially somebody you care about so much,"" Gatson said.</p> <p>DeWolf's parents, who repeatedly praised the Ann Arbor Police Department, hope the case goes to trial so they can get resolution and start the healing process.</p> <p>""Right now it's like an open wound, and you just keep scratching the scab off,"" Thom DeWolf said. ""It just doesn't heal right now.""</p> <p>Those close to DeWolf are working to honor him and keep his memory alive.</p> <p>They're in the process of trying to get a scholarship in his name, as well as an honorary M.D. so he will be in this year's graduating class picture, Duratinsky said.</p> <p>""He's sorely missed here in Ann Arbor, in the medical school community; he's sorely missed back home,"" he said. ""It's a complete tragedy. It's a tragedy for all of us who knew him. It's a tragedy for everyone who would have known him in the future.""</p> <p>Copyright 2014   USATODAY.com</p> <p>Read the original story: Parents, police seek answers in med student's slaying</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.842558"", ""count"": ""19"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Joshua DeWolf""}, {""relevance"": ""0.72486"", ""count"": ""9"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Paul DeWolf""}, {""relevance"": ""0.650009"", ""count"": ""7"", ""type"": ""Company"", ""text"": ""DeWolf""}, {""relevance"": ""0.512934"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.a2gov.org/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"", ""census"": ""http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/geo/us/mi/counties/washtenaw_county/ann_arbor"", ""name"": ""Ann Arbor, Michigan"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0wh3"", ""subType"": [""GovernmentalJurisdiction""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"", ""geo"": ""42.223 -83.74566666666666"", ""geonames"": ""http://sws.geonames.org/4984247/""}, ""text"": ""Ann Arbor""}, {""relevance"": ""0.372157"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Ann Arbor""}, {""relevance"": ""0.367506"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Earle_Foxe"", ""subType"": [""Actor"", ""FilmActor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earle_Foxe"", ""name"": ""Earle Foxe"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0krwhp""}, ""text"": ""Sgt.

chronicle.augusta.com/news/crime-courts/2013-08-28/defense-setbacks-toddler-slaying-trial?v=1377718153,Augusta,GA,Defense setbacks in toddler-slaying trial | The Augusta Chronicle,20130828T105200,"<p>Prosecutors had wrapped up their own case Wednesday morning with the testimony of Sherry West, the mother of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago. West was shot in the leg March 21 during what prosecutors call an attempted robbery.</p> <p>She has identified DeMarquise Elkins, 18, as the gunman. He is being tried in Cobb County because of the amount of news coverage in Glynn County, where the shootings occurred.</p> <p>Before Elkins attorneys could resume their cross-examination of West, Judge Stephen Kelley ruled on a prosecution motion that had halted testimony Tuesday evening. He blocked the attorneys from questioning West about any alleged drug use, sex for drugs or mistreatment of her older children a decade ago.</p> <p>Kelley concluded those allegations were not recent enough or similar enough to the childs death for defense attorneys to bring up as ways to show someone else shot Antonio.</p> <p>The reason the court has to have these rules is boundaries, he said.</p> <p>He also denied defense motions to toss out the individual charges against Elkins and his mother, Karimah Elkins, 36, who is being tried on charges of providing a false alibi to police on his behalf and of evidence tampering.</p> <p>Kelley postponed seven defense motions for a mistrial for various reasons.</p> <p>During Wests final moments of cross-examination, she repeatedly batted away questions about whether she had changed her story in talking to the police and reporters or whether she had misidentified Elkins. To most questions she replied, I dont recall or possibly.</p> <p>I just remember identifying him and being sure, she said.</p> <p>The first defense witness was Wests 21-year-old estranged daughter, Ashley Glassey, of Runnemede, N.J., who was released from a New Jersey jail on shoplifting charges long enough to testify.</p> <p>During tearful testimony, Glassey said she never met Antonio and hadnt seen her mother before Wednesday except briefly four years ago ever since West lost custody when Glassey was 8. West called her the evening of the killing to give the news of her stepbrothers death.</p> <p>She asked me how long I thought it would take to get the life insurance policy, the check to come, Glassey said, explaining that she was familiar with insurance after having recently handled her grandmothers affairs.</p> <p>That night, Glassey had trouble sleeping because in the retelling over the phone West had changed the order of who was shot first, mother or child. It bothered Glassey enough to call Brunswick police, who never returned the call or investigated, according to the testimony.</p> <p>Some things she said to me just didnt add up, Glassey said. I felt like I got blown off (by police).</p> <p>West sat ramrod straight in the second row of the audience, wringing her hands, as Glassey told how her mother had memory problems and instructed her not to talk to reporters.</p> <p>The next defense witness was Linda Knight, a retired speech pathologist who lived across the street from the shooting scene. She said she was in the rear of her house when she heard three gunshots and ran to the front door, which opens onto London Street.</p> <p>I couldnt see anything, she said, adding that only the stroller handle and Wests head were visible behind some shrubs.</p> <p>Im sorry if I said it the wrong way, she apologized to defense attorney Kevin Gough.</p> <p>She said that her daughter had been able to see more of the scene.</p> <p>The defense is expected present a deposition from a man who rode up on a bicycle shortly after the shooting and used a cellphone Knights daughter had but was too panicked to call 911.</p> <p>We know he is guilty, we just have to wait for the jury to say so. His punishment should be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But do not put him in front of a firing squad, instead have an electronic firing device attached to a pistol, restrain him hand and foot, and bind him where no movement would be possible. Why do this, you ask? The baby he shot did not know he was about to be shot, and did not know to try to get out of the way, but this low life piece of human debris knows to try to get out of the way. Set the timer on the device to pull the trigger at random, and make sure it is aimed at his heart. Cruel and unusual punishment, you say? Not as cruel as shooting a defenseless baby. Besides, someone like this piece of scum would not make it in prison. So save the money and eliminate the problem.</p> <p>your honor my client is just a ""po boy who lost his father"" and because of racism and slavery causing him to lash out because the child and his mother have white skin.  he didn't mean to kill the child but my client is innocent of murder due to racism and slavery, and thatg he should be given a pass, 40 acres and a mule, plus a million dollars becasue his ancestors were slaves......folks this will be the defense for this animal when the only just compensation should be a .45 slug to the back of the head for him and his sorry azz welfare, parasitic, broodmare mammy...</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.825052"", ""count"": ""11"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Ashley Glassey""}, {""relevance"": ""0.704349"", ""count"": ""10"",

www.news-reporter.com/news/2013-08-29/Front_Page/Dont_forget_fireworks_at_Monday_nights_big_Labor_D.html,Washington,GA,Dont forget fireworks at Monday nights big Labor Day celebration | www.news-reporter.com | News-Reporter,20130829T000000,"<p>Big crowds are expected on The Square Monday evening as Washington Wilkes celebrates Labor Day like its the Fourth of July.</p> <p>The Labor Day Festival and fireworks show is the rescheduled replacement for the rained-out Independence Day celebration July 3, and will have something for everyone, Washington-Wilkes Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Lyndon Amis said.</p> <p>The event will have music, food, and fun for families, including a return of a big inflatable slide and a bungee-style suspended Spider Jump.</p> <p>The Big Slide and the Spider Jump were very popular when they were here last time, Tourism Director Erin Pollock said. We were very lucky to get the insurance cleared to have these two attractions come back, because everybody loves them.</p> <p>Music will be provided by The Remedy, and Brittany Gebing will sing the National Anthem.</p> <p>Food vendors will be offering fried Oreos, jerk chicken and pork, barbeque, fish and grits, shrimp and grits, fresh-squeezed lemonade, along with the usual hamburgers and hot dogs, she said. And all of our restaurants will be open Monday night, so be sure to dine out.</p> <p>The Washington Fire Department will be spraying water from its ladder truck for kids to play in. We hope thats all the water that will be falling from the sky, Pollock said. The weather forecast looks good.</p> <p>After the Independence Day event was rained out, the chamber leadership worked with city merchants, vendors, and the fireworks company, Melrose Pyrotechnics, to schedule an alternative date. We settled on Labor Day, Monday, September 2, and we hope each of you will make plans to come downtown.</p> <p>Again this year, the community worked together to raise the funds needed to put on a fireworks show, whenever it happens.

Police later found the boy wounded in the SUV at the intersection of 17th Avenue and Virginia Street. He died from gunshot wounds to the chin and pelvis.</p> <p>In the days after the crime, Gary police questioned the boy's father, Terry L. Bethel, and named him a person of interest in the case. In July 2010, Shaw filed a civil lawsuit against Bethel and his brother Joe Noel, alleging the two caused Josiah's death.</p> <p>Carter's office has reviewed allegations that someone attempted to falsely take a paternity test for Bethel.</p> <p>Neither Bethel nor Noel has been charged in the shootings.</p> <p>The newlook at the criminal case comes as Noel was interviewed Monday as part of the civil suit. The suit initially was set to go to trial Monday, but was postponed in July when Shaw's lawyer, Darnail Lyles, requested more time to gather evidence.</p> <p>The men's attorney, Scott King, said of the case, ""I don't think any additional evidence has been developed to contest our contention that neither Mr. Noel, nor anybody related to or associated with him, is in any way responsible for this tragedy.""</p> <p>Lyles said Kwana Shaw's determination has not wavered in her pursuit of justice for her son.</p> <p>""She has not relented in her desire to have this go forward, either civilly or criminally,"" Lyles said.</p> <p>Whether or when a criminal case will be filed has been the subject of speculation for years. The Shaws and supporters have expressed frustration at the lack of charges, pursuing their own civil justice. Meanwhile, Carter has said more work is needed to build a strong case worthy of a courtroom.</p> <p>""If we felt there was sufficient evidence, we would've charged a long time ago,"" Carter said.

www.cdapress.com/news/local_news/article_21aa0956-f252-5026-b2ab-0d2fbeaa9ba8.html,Coeur_dAlene,ID,These numbers are deadly - Coeur d'Alene Press: Local News,20130930T000000,"<p>The report was released to coincide with domestic violence awareness month in October.</p> <p>Nationwide, 1,707 females were murdered by males in single-victim-single-offender incidents in 2011. That's a nationwide rate of 1.17 homicides per 100,000 females, compared with Idaho's rate of 1.77.</p> <p>Idaho's neighbors ranked lower, including Washington which had a rate of 1.02, Montana at 0.81, and Oregon at 1.13.</p> <p>The study results don't surprise Susan Koerner, who is a domestic violence victims' advocate - among other duties - for the Kootenai County prosecutor's office. She believes Idaho's ranking is fair.</p> <p>""Our area has some of the highest rates of domestic violence in the state of Idaho, which also has very high rates of domestic violence,"" Koerner said.</p> <p>""Thankfully there have not been many murders, (but) we have had many cases of attempted strangulation which are very serious and could lead to death,"" Koerner said.</p> <p>Idaho had 14 female homicide victims (in single-victim-single-offender cases) in 2011, while Washington had 35, Montana had four and Oregon had 22.</p> <p>""There is still a culture in our state that this is just a family problem and the government doesn't need to be involved in these situations,"" Koerner said. ""Idaho has been greatly affected by the recession and women have not been calling in to report early incidents of domestic violence. They are waiting until their injuries can be life-threatening to make a call to law enforcement or the local shelter.""</p> <p>Nationwide, for homicides in which the victim-to-offender relationship could be identified, 94 percent of female victims were murdered by a male they knew.</p> <p>For the homicides in Idaho in which the weapon used could be identified, 75 percent were committed with guns, and 93 percent (13 out of 14) of the women were murdered by someone they knew.</p> <p>One of those murders was committed by Joseph Herrera in St. Maries on Christmas day 2011. He shot and killed his girlfriend, 18-year-old Stefanie Comack, during an argument.</p> <p>The recent report was completed by the Violence Policy Center, in Washington, D.C. The center is a national educational organization working to stop gun death and injury.</p> <p>""The sad reality is that women are nearly always murdered by someone they know,"" Kristen Rand, the center's legislative director, said in a news release.</p> <p>""Nine women each week are shot to death by their husband or intimate partner,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.</p> <p>South Carolina topped the center's list with 2.54 murders of females by males per 100,000 females. Alaska had a rate of 2.01, and Oklahoma was at 1.99, for second and third, respectively, on the list.</p> <p>MIke, the Bible is emphatic on how husbands are to treat their wives.  I suggest you look at Ephesians 5:22-25 and 1 Cor 13.  Christ never, never said to abuse your wife or your children.  He asked husbands to love their wife as much and if not more than themselves.  Christ knew that men and women were different.  Men need respect for who they are, they need to feel appreciated for the work they do and women need kindness and love from their husbands.  Abuse, eventually leading to murder is not part of the Bible. Have you seen abuse?.  Have you seen a women's body loaded with cigarette burns in places where the average person cannot see?.  Some men are clever about how and where they abuse their women.  Have you seen the broken arms, black eyes, strangulation marks on their necks? I have.  Jesus Christ does not equate abuse with being subject to their husbands.  Are you subject to your boss?  Where you subject to your parents growing up? Do you equate subject with abuse? Read the above verses and you can tell this blog whether Men can abuse their wives based on those readings.</p> <p>I looked at the 2010 statistics and Idaho was ranked 22nd with a rate of 1.28 per 100,000 for this single victim - single offender figure. That year there were 10 such victims so even a couple of extra homicides of this type can skew the annual statistics. It is hard to know if such cultural factors are present as the article suggests unless you make the argument as I would that is not an Idaho specific characteristic but rather a nationwide issue. Still, it is getting better as nationwide this number has trended downward over the years. Kudos to all who are helping keep this crime even rarer.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.793727"", ""count"": ""9"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"":

Each is charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery for the heist at Zions Bank in Twin Falls.</p> <p>Rowe is known to law enforcement, Elko County Undersheriff Clair Morris said.</p> <p>He's been involved in drug activity,'' Morris said, and is known to have weapons and explosives.</p> <p>Authorities wanted to avoid a confrontation at the Rowes residence because of concern for their children and the proximity to schools.</p> <p>We thought we'd try to catch him while he was moving,'' Morris said.</p> <p>Rowe took off, leading officers on a 20-mile chase on dirt roads north of Carlin, a town just west of Elko along Interstate 80.</p> <p>Rowe abandoned the vehicle when it got stuck on a dirt road in the Swale Mountain area, then took off on foot, Morris said. Police chased him for another 3 or 4 miles. Carlin police, Elko County (Nev.) deputies, Twin Falls police, Elko police and Nevada Highway Patrol troopers all were in pursuit.</p> <p>Deputies said Rowe pointed a rifle at them and a Carlin officer shot him in the stomach.</p> <p>Rowe was taken into custody and transported by air ambulance to an Elko-area hospital where he initially was in critical condition. He later was transported to St. Alophonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, where he was in serious condition Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Rowe is expected to be released from the hospital today and taken to the Elko County Jail, said Elko County Sheriff Jim Pitts. Bauer said he will be held on $1 million bond.</p> <p>The Carlin officer who shot him has not been identified but has been placed on administrative leave according to policy, Carlin Police Chief Bill Bauer said.</p> <p>Because almost all Elko law enforcement agencies were involved, the shooting is being investigated by the Nevada Department of Public Safety Investigation Division and the Washoe County (Nev.) Crime Lab.</p> <p>Linda Rowe, 37, came out of the couples residence in Carlin a few hours after the chase and was arrested. Shes being held on a $500,000 bond at the Elko County Jail. She will be brought to Twin Falls after an extradition hearing, said Twin Falls police Sgt. John Wilson.</p> <p>The Investigation</p> <p>A police report outlined the investigation into the robbery:</p> <p>Immediately after the robbery, Twin Falls police began interviewing witnesses. Several people in the bank remembered the bright clothing that the robber wore. Others said he left on a red dirt bike northbound, so officers began searching the area near the bridge and quickly found the red dirt bike that witnesses said was the getaway vehicle.</p> <p>Another witness said he saw a woman waiting in a blue pickup in the Outback Steakhouse parking lot.</p> <p>A man who was golfing in Canyon Springs Golf Couse said he saw the blue truck and red dirt bike parked along a road near the golf course. Later, when he saw pictures of the robber on the news, the man recognized him as the person hed seen that morning.</p> <p>The main break in the case came Aug. 26, when Ryan Eppers called police and told them neighbor John Bierwag had told him that his relatives, the Rowes, had robbed a bank.</p> <p>Police spoke with Bierwag on Sunday. He revealed that he, the Rowes and their three children, ages 10, 14 and 17, had stayed in a Twin Falls hotel about a mile from Zions Bank.</p> <p>Bierwag, who is Linda Rowe's brother, told police he watched the Rowes children in the hotel room during the time the bank was robbed. Bierwag said the couple told him they were going to sell their dirt bike.</p> <p>Later, the two returned to the hotel room, and Rowe asked for a razor so he could shave his beard. Ever since July 9, Bierwag said, Rowe has mentioned that he needs to rob another bank ""because the first one didn't work.</p> <p>The Associated Press and Elko Free Press contributed to this report.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.881235"", ""count"": ""13"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Linda Rowe""}, {""relevance"": ""0.450124"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"",

He shot his way through the front door, then used the handgun to threaten residents in the 300 block of Springmeadow Drive.</p> <p>He was armed when he was shot, Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Todd Shaver said. He had a handgun and was threatening people in the house.</p> <p>Shaver, commander of the Winnebago-Boone County Integrity Task Force, is leading an investigation into the shooting. The task force ensures that law enforcement agencies do not investigate shootings involving their own officers and is supposed to assure the public of a thorough inquiry.</p> <p>Its findings will be presented to Boone County States Attorney Michelle Courier, who must determine whether the shooting was legally justified and decide whether to present the case to a grand jury.</p> <p>The intruder was believed to have had a romantic relationship with one of the residents of the house and to be involved in a dispute over a small amount of money.</p> <p>The house stood in contrast Monday to the rest of the well-manicured Prairie Green neighborhood where residents pride themselves on their vigilance.

Even 15 years after his slaying, she can feel what it would be like to wrap her arms around him in a big hug. Oh, God, wouldnt that be nice, she says, fighting back the tears.</p> <p>Editor's note: This captions that accompany this story were edited to correct the spelling of Joan Gitchel's name.</p> <p>ROCKFORD  Joan Gitchel sometimes imagines her son walking up the sidewalk to her house and coming through the front door.</p> <p>Even 15 years after his homicide, she can feel what it would be like to wrap her arms around him in a big hug.</p> <p>Oh, God, wouldnt that be nice, she says, fighting back the tears.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago this week  April 30, 1998  a killer sat with Dan Myers, 32, in his pickup parked on Cunningham Road just outside Rockford. He put a gun to Myers head, just below his right ear, and pulled the trigger.</p> <p>Myers body was dragged out of his truck. He was found face down in broken glass near the driveway of liquor store. The killer got in and drove a few blocks away, abandoning the truck in front of someones house.</p> <p>No one was ever charged with Myers killing. No one was arrested. No witnesses were found. And every day that passes, the case gets colder and chances get slimmer that anyone will face justice.</p> <p>Since 2000, the Rockford Police and Winnebago County Sheriffs departments have investigated 261 homicides. Twenty-five more were investigated in Ogle and Boone counties, including Belvidere, according to a database compiled by the Register Star using public-records requests.</p> <p>The cases are far from forgotten. Each leaves behind grieving, broken families.</p> <p>Detectives review all open homicides periodically. Officers try to take a fresh look at the cases, search for new angles, track down any leads when new information comes to light.</p> <p>Family members, including Gitchel and Myers father, Tony, are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who comes forward with information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for Myers death.</p> <p>Someone in the public knows what happened to him. Perhaps the reward money will convince someone they owe it to his family to come forward, Deputy Chief Sheriff Dominic Iasparro said. They can tell police what they know or report it to Crime Stoppers confidentially.</p> <p>The family desperately wants to know what happened to their son and they have every right in the world to demand answers, he said. Somebody within this community knows those answers.</p> <p>As time passes, those answers become more difficult to get.</p> <p>Myers was born and raised in Rockford. He was the baby of the family and had two older sisters. He attended Holy Family, Lincoln Middle and dropped out of East High when he struggled with alcoholism.</p> <p>Page 2 of 3 -    	In spring 1998, Myers had been living in Janesville, Wis., but was moving to Rockford to live with a girlfriend the day of his death. After moving some of his things to a residence on Charles Street, he went out with friends.</p> <p>They went to a bar on Broadway, then to Rockys Tap, family members said. Myers told his friends he was leaving; they told police it wasnt clear where he was going, but police suspect that he might have been attempting to buy drugs.</p> <p>A mailman found Myers body the next day.</p> <p>Myers was a man who tended to fall in with the wrong crowd. But he was a hard worker, a talented carpenter who specialized in building decks, and was beloved by friends and family.</p> <p>Deputies interviewed Myers girlfriend, friends and family. Even a gangster who was once a person of interest. None developed into suspects.</p> <p>There was a dead end at every turn.</p> <p>Family members have their suspicions about who is responsible. They once hired a private investigator when the police efforts stalled and consulted a psychic the private investigator said was reputable.</p> <p>The private investigation didnt reveal any new leads. Neither did the psychic.</p> <p>Im sure its a huge stretch for a lot of people, the whole psychic thing, but we ... were stretching, we were desperate, sister Chris Myers said.</p> <p>Gitchels pain and anger are raw.</p> <p>I hate to think of this person after 15 years enjoying his nice life, Gitshechel said. I think about it all the time. Its hard to get out of your mind.</p> <p>Dan was such a special, loving, caring person. It hurts. And it hurts every day. Its not an every-once-in-a-while thing.</p> <p>The familys most fervent wish is that someone would take responsibility for his death. Not knowing who killed her brother or why is daily torture, sister Michele Loerke said.</p> <p>His loss has caused an irreplaceable hole in the family. The not-knowing.

Christopher Bailey said. A woman and a small child also inside the home were unharmed, he said.</p> <p>The officer killed, Rod Bradway, and at least one other officer went to the apartment complex on the citys northwest side about 2 a.m. after someone called 911 to report a disturbance.</p> <p>When he arrived to the apartment door, he heard a woman scream for help inside the apartment, Bailey said.</p> <p>Bradway forced his way inside and was shot, Bailey said. The 41-year-old officer was taken to Wishard Memorial Hospital, where he died a short time later.</p> <p>Investigators were still working Friday morning to confirm the gunmans identity and the circumstances surrounding his death. The child was taken by child protective services, said police spokesman Officer Kendale Adams, who had no other details on the child.</p> <p>Bradway, who was married with a teenage son and daughter, was a five-year veteran of the police department, according to police. He was a native of the northern Indiana town of Nappanee.</p> <p>Police Chief Rick Hite asked the public to pray for Bradways family.</p> <p>He entered an apartment to save the life of a woman who was being assaulted and in turn gave his life, Hite told reporters outside the hospital. Blessed are the peacemakers.</p> <p>The department said Bradway was a highly decorated officer who had received its Medal of Bravery in February 2012.</p> <p>A few dozen police squad cars escorted a vehicle carrying Bradways body as it left the hospital about 6 a.m. on its way to the coroners office.</p> <p>Adams said Bradway had helped with relief efforts in the aftermath of Mays deadly Moore, Okla., tornado. Bradways wife, Jamie, wrote in the June issue of the citys Department of Public Safety newsletter that she and her husband helped collect supplies for pets displaced or found wandering in the storms aftermath</p> <p>The couple delivered to Moores animal shelter 28 pet crates, hundreds of pounds of dog and cat food, leashes, water bowls, animal toys and other items, she wrote. They were on hand when a family was happily reunited with their dog.</p> <p>The shooting prompted Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard to cut short a trip to Germany for a business summit and return to Indianapolis. In a statement, the mayor said Bradway gave his life protecting the people of our community by charging ahead to confront the unknown.</p> <p>Bradway is the first Indianapolis police officer killed in the line of duty since Officer David Moore was shot during a traffic stop on the morning of Jan. 23, 2011. Moore, the son of two police officers, died three days later.</p> <p>Associated Press writer Tom Davies contributed to this report from Indianapolis.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.82405"", ""count"": ""12"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Rod Bradway""}, {""relevance"": ""0.707962"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""officer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.540891"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Officer David Moore""}, {""relevance"": ""0.485729"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Officer Kendale Adams""}, {""relevance"": ""0.483894"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.indy.gov/Pages/Home.aspx"", ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis"", ""geo"": ""39.790942 -86.147685"", ""name"": ""Indianapolis"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0ftxw""}, ""text"": ""INDIANAPOLIS""}, {""relevance"": ""0.457623"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""subType"": [""Athlete"", ""RugbyPlayer""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Bailey_(rugby_league)"", ""name"": ""Chris Bailey (rugby league)"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0413hhp""}, ""text"": ""Lt.

www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x853687700/Police-procedure-at-Ashland-shooting-scene-questioned,Framingham,MA,"Police procedure at Ashland shooting scene questioned - News - MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA - Framingham, MA",20130712T000000,"<p>While the Middlesex District Attorneys office remains tight-lipped about its probe into the July 2 incident in which an Ashland officer shot and killed a man, some in town are questioning whether police handled the situation correctly.</p> <p>In a letter to the editor sent to the Daily News this week, former Ashland Selectmen Chairman Jon Fetherston asks whether police acted wisely by following Andrew Stigliano into his 13 Metropolitan Ave. home instead of surrounding the house and calling for additional backup such as a SWAT team.</p> <p>Ashland interim Police Chief Stephen Doherty Thursday said the department does not have a policy on exactly when to call a SWAT team. He said every situation is different and officers rely on instincts developed through training to maneuver a tense situation.</p> <p>""Our recent situation evolved one thing after another, bang, bang, bang,"" he said.</p> <p>Doherty, a former Wakefield chief who was also interim chief in Duxbury and at Fisher College, said a special operations team should only be called if police know where in a building a suspect is and if they have enough resources to contain the perimeter.</p> <p>""There's no static answer that can be applied to every situation,"" he said.</p> <p>Framingham Deputy Chief Craig Davis, however, said his department has faced similar situations and he would have acted much differently.</p> <p>Davis, making it clear that he does not know the specifics of the Ashland incident, said he would have tried to contain the situation, slow it down and talk the person out of the house.</p> <p>""Really, one of the last phases you want to do is to go into a house after somebody,"" Davis said. He said he always assumes a person is armed if they run into a house away from police.</p> <p>But, he added, ""all these situations are dynamic, they change all the time.""</p> <p>Framingham police have also dealt recently with a police-involved fatal shooting.</p> <p>After the Jan. 5, 2011 incident in Framingham when an officer accidentally discharged his SWAT rifle and killed an unarmed elderly man, the department changed its policy following an independent review.</p> <p>Now SWAT officers are required to keep SWAT rifles in the safety position unless there is a perceived threat. The Framingham officer who killed Eurie Stamps Sr. was not charged and the shooting was deemed accidental during a SWAT raid on a house when officers were looking for a man wanted on drug charges.</p> <p>Doherty said it is common for departments not to have a strict policy for when to call in special teams. He said the recent incident, which began when an officer attempted to serve Stigliano a warrant, escalated over the course of about four minutes, meaning there wasnt even time to call in off-duty officers.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.919664"", ""count"": ""8"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Deputy Chief Craig Davis""}, {""relevance"": ""0.743407"", ""count"": ""5"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Stephen Doherty""}, {""relevance"": ""0.722783"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Ashland""}, {""relevance"": ""0.658855"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""officer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.569957"", ""count"": ""5"", ""type"": ""FieldTerminology"", ""text"": ""the house""}, {""relevance"": ""0.499418"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""FieldTerminology"", ""text"": ""Police Chief""}, {""relevance"": ""0.42154"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Andrew Stigliano""}, {""relevance"": ""0.394981"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Framingham""}, {""relevance"": ""0.373028"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Company"", ""text"": ""Stigliano""}, {""relevance"": ""0.366946"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Jon Fetherston""}, {""relevance"": ""0.359313"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""text"": ""Middlesex District""}, {""relevance"": ""0.331634"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""Chairman""}, {""relevance"": ""0.33101"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""editor""}, {""relevance"": ""0.328316"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""PrintMedia"", ""text"": ""Daily News""}, {""relevance"": ""0.32769"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.town.duxbury.ma.us/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Duxbury,_Massachusetts"", ""name"": ""Duxbury, Massachusetts"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01m89c"", ""subType"": [], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duxbury,_Massachusetts""}, ""text"": ""Duxbury""}, {""relevance"": ""0.322094"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.fisher.edu"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Fisher_College"", ""name"": ""Fisher College"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.04b2nf"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""CollegeUniversity"", ""University""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fisher_College""}, ""text"": ""Fisher College""}, {""relevance"": ""0.319213"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""Attorney""}, {""relevance"": ""0.302872"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Eurie Stamps Sr.""}, {""relevance"": ""0.292063"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Wakefield""}, {""relevance"": ""0.292063"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Quantity"", ""text"": ""four minutes""}]","[{""relevance"": ""0.938609"", ""text"": ""SWAT team""}, {""relevance"": ""0.85251"", ""text"": ""Ashland Selectmen Chairman""}, {""relevance"": ""0.846206"", ""text"": ""Ashland interim Police""}, {""relevance"": ""0.842792"", ""text"": ""Framingham Deputy Chief""}, {""relevance"": ""0.840697"", ""text"": ""Chief Stephen Doherty""}, {""relevance"": ""0.801486"", ""text"": ""Middlesex District Attorney""}, {""relevance"": ""0.795155"", ""text"": ""Metropolitan Ave. home""}, {""relevance"": ""0.754989"", ""text"": ""special operations team""}, {""relevance"": ""0.745182"", ""text"": ""situation""}, {""relevance"": ""0.732743"", ""text"": ""unarmed elderly man""}, {""relevance"": ""0.728638"", ""text"": ""police-involved fatal shooting""}, {""relevance"": ""0.714989"", ""text"": ""Eurie Stamps Sr.""}, {""relevance"": ""0.712341"", ""text"": ""SWAT officers""}, {""relevance"": ""0.709664"", ""text"": ""SWAT rifle""}, {""relevance"": ""0.709384"", ""text"": ""tense situation""}, {""relevance"": ""0.708736"", ""text"": ""SWAT rifles""}, {""relevance"": ""0.70358"", ""text"": ""SWAT raid""}, {""relevance"": ""0.697925"", ""text"": ""Ashland officer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.694897"", ""text"": ""recent situation""}, {""relevance"": ""0.677681"", ""text"": ""Ashland incident""}, {""relevance"": ""0.674313"", ""text"": ""Andrew Stigliano""}, {""relevance"": ""0.651672"", ""text"": ""Framingham officer""}, {""relevance"": ""0.649917"", ""text"": ""Framingham police""}, {""relevance"": ""0.635951"", ""text"": ""interim chief""}, {""relevance"": ""0.6299"", ""text"": ""Jon Fetherston""}, {""relevance"": ""0.624127"", ""text"": ""Wakefield chief""}, {""relevance"": ""0.617894"", ""text"": ""recent incident""}, {""relevance"": ""0.616541"", ""text"": ""Daily News""}, {""relevance"": ""0.595654"", ""text"": ""off-duty officers""}, {""relevance"": ""0.595066"", ""text"": ""similar situations""}]"

www.pressherald.com/news/Investigation_of_North_Yarmouth_shooting_death_continues.html?pageType=mobile&id=1,Portland,MA,Police probe whether Maine shooting was justified - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,20131008T000000,"<p>NORTH YARMOUTH  Police are trying to determine whether a Yarmouth man was justified in fatally shooting a Georgetown man during a confrontation Sunday.</p> <p>Merrill Mike Kimball, 70, of Yarmouth, shot and killed Leon Kelley, 63, outside Browns Bee Farm off Greely Road on Sunday afternoon, say Maine State Police.</p> <p>Each man is related to a co-owner of the business. Kelley, a lobsterman from Georgetown, was a son-in-law of Stan Brown, a well-known beekeeper who founded the business and remains an owner. Kimball, a lobsterman from Yarmouth, is married to Karen Thurlow-Kimball, who police said also is an owner.</p> <p>Police did not arrest Kimball on Sunday, saying he has been cooperative and they are still trying to determine what prompted the shooting and the extent of the confrontation that preceded it.</p> <p>There is no threat to the public, number one, and, number two, we need to understand the circumstances under which this shooting occurred, state police spokesman Steve McCausland said Monday.</p> <p>Kimball has been cooperative with investigators, he said. We have talked to him and we probably will talk to him again.</p> <p>There were reports of shoving just before the shooting, though police would not confirm those reports.</p> <p>An autopsy by the state medical examiner showed that Kelley died of multiple gunshots to the torso.</p> <p>Deputy Attorney General William Stokes said police had more investigating to do before determining whether the shooting was criminal homicide.</p> <p>Police were called to Browns Bee Farm, near the Val Halla Golf and Recreation Center, just after 3 p.m. Sunday for reports of a shooting. The business is right behind Browns house at 239 Greely Road, off a dirt road called Honey Comb Drive.</p> <p>Kelley was taken in an ambulance to Maine Medical Center in Portland, but died en route.</p> <p>He was remembered by friends Monday as a salt-of-the-earth native son. Those friends struggled to accept that he was shot and killed.</p> <p>Ive known him my whole life, said Bill Plummer, a selectman in Georgetown, as he grabbed lunch at the Georgetown Country Store.</p> <p>We didnt believe it. Then I saw his truck on the news. It was sickening, Plummer said.</p> <p>He said Kelley was from Georgetown, served in Vietnam and, after he returned, moved to Massachusetts and became a truck driver. Twenty years ago, he settled back in town and became a lobsterman.</p> <p>The Maine humorist Tim Sample used to live in Georgetown, and over time got to know Leon Kelley as a friend and a familiar face on the towns waterfront. Sample said he knew Kelley for more than 20 years and he was a great person to be around because of his big heart and work ethic.</p> <p>He was a big, tall, handsome guy who looked like a lobsterman from central casting, Sample said.</p> <p>George Dufour, Georgetowns harbormaster, said he moved to town 11 years ago and had known Kelley since then. I used to buy lobster from him, Dufour said.</p> <p>After he became harbormaster eight years ago, they continued to get along well.</p> <p>I never saw him get too riled up except when I was telling him what to do, Dufour said with a smile. Fishermen dont like to be told what to do.</p> <p>But in a small town like Georgetown, population 1,000, they do help each other out in a crisis. Dufour said Georgetown residents have already started volunteering to help haul and winterize Kelleys boat.</p> <p>The 23-foot, green-hulled lobster boat bobbed at its mooring off the Five Islands section of town Monday. A raw rain fell and a windblown chop kept most fishermen from going out. The picturesque harbor, busy during the summer tourism season, was almost deserted.</p> <p>Dufour stared out at the gray harbor.</p> <p>Its quite a shame  some kind of family altercation  push came to shove  push, push, push and it got beyond the limit, he said.</p> <p>Kelleys son Bryan Kelley, who also lives in Georgetown, said he did not want to comment about his fathers death. He said he and his fathers wife had more pressing things to do.</p> <p>Kelleys sister-in-law Anne Brown said the loss is painful.</p> <p>He was such a great guy. When he hugged you, boy, you knew it, she said. This is the worst thing that could happen.</p> <p>Rusty Parmenter, a lobsterman who lives in Yarmouth near Kimball, couldnt say what led to the shooting. He said he has known Kimball for almost 20 years, since Parmenter was a teenager.</p> <p>I think hes a good man, he said. Hardworking, keeps to himself.</p> <p>It was unclear whether the business relationship between Thurlow-Kimball and Stan Brown, who is 93 and in declining health, contributed to a dispute between the two families.</p> <p>Ron Lefebvre, Kelleys nephew, said the shooting has shaken Stan Brown, his grandfather.</p> <p>Hes (nearly) 94 years and hes sick, Lefebvre said. This doesnt help.</p> <p>Reached at his home Monday, Brown said he couldnt hear very well and handed the phone to his daughter, Anne Brown.</p> <p>I wished I knew what happened, she said. Police havent told us anything, but they are working really hard to figure it out.</p> <p>Staff Writers Dennis Hoey, Eric Russell and Leslie Bridgers contributed to this report.</p> <p>David Hench can

www.bayweekly.com/articles/arts-and-culture/books,Deale,MD,Arts and Culture (Books) | Bay Weekly,20141023T000000,"<p>If the medium is the message, then theres more to be learned from Calvert Librarys huge festival of local authors than youll read in this weeks feature story, The Writers Next Door.</p> <p>Your neighbor may have written just the one for you, I say, introducing 33 authors and their latest (or favorite) books. These are quick introductions, the literary equivalent of speed dating, with a life compressed into one sentence and a plot into another. At the May 31 festival, youll meet even more authors from 9:30 am to 4pm.</p> <p>All thats just the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>The submerged message is that Calvert Countys public library system is ambitious in a big way to be a place where people connect with ideas and each other.</p> <p>You see it in the Prince Frederick library building, built in 2006 to change the way people use their libraries. Twenty-first century libraries will trend that way, using architecture and location to draw people in and interior design to make them feel comfortable, welcome and ready to stay a while.</p> <p>Libraries of the future will be community centers  with the visual appeal of bookstores  according to Anne Arundel Public Library director Skip Auld, whos thinking toward a new Annapolis Public Library that will be state-of-the-art.</p> <p>Sending the message that your library is the center of your community is more than putting it in a place people are likely to go. Its more than a light-filled building with maritime and local allusions, human-sized spaces and comfortable chairs.</p> <p>The medium of that message has to be that here, as in Alices Restaurant of Arlo Guthries song, you can get anything you want.</p> <p>Thats just about true of our 19 libraries, in Anne Arundel as well as in Calvert.</p> <p>Theyre open when you want to go. This year, Anne Arundel libraries regained the county funding to open every branch from 9am to 9pm four days a week, and until 5pm Fridays and Saturdays, with some Sunday hours in regional centers. Calverts libraries have always opened 9am to 9pm four days, with shorter hours Friday (noon-5pm) and Saturday (9am-5pm).</p> <p>Along with longer hours, the Anne Arundel library system added 31 new staffers.</p> <p>Many of Anne Arundels new service are devoted to kids. The libraries Early Literacy Initiative runs 144 programs a year for infants through five-year-olds, as well as reaching out to schools and Head Start centers.</p> <p>Bay Weeklys Kids Time at the Libraries lists as many as 50 kids programs each week. Of course kids programs involve grown-ups as well, and often stuffed animals.</p> <p>Thats another part of the message: programs for people of all ages. Stories, songs, fingerplays and stuffed-animal sleepovers for kiddies  Legos, homework help and tutors on call for kids  pizza parties and games, both board and electronic, for teens  and for all ages, computers, shelves and shelves of books in print (large and small) and on recording, collections of databases, movies, music and games  and all for free.</p> <p>Five years ago in Wisconsin, Todd Bol built a model of a one-room schoolhouse as a tribute to his mother, a former teacher. He installed it on a post in his front yard and filled it with books to give away. It was such a hit with his neighbors that he built and gave away several more, each with a sign that read free books.</p> <p>Is it coincidence that graduation coincides so closely to Memorial Day, when we honor those lost in battle, so many of whom don a uniform upon leaving school?</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.974645"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""subType"": [],

But, he said, she kept coming and he emptied the clip. He then reloaded.</p> <p>Investigators found 11 empty 9 mm shell cases on the roadway near where Alger was shot, the court documents said.</p> <p>Webster told police that after he shot Alger he tried to shoot himself, but the gun did not fire.</p> <p>Minutes after the shooting, Webster was arrested nearby.</p> <p>During Websters brief arraignment, Deputy Franklin County States Attorney John Lavoie called the shooting an act of extreme violence.</p> <p>It was a random act. The defendant and Ms. Alger had no relationship whatsoever, Lavoie said.</p> <p>Algers family was in the courtroom during the arraignment. Several cried loudly while Lavoie described parts of the shooting. Afterward they declined to comment to reporters.</p> <p>The charge against Webster carries a possible sentence of life in prison.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.853701"", ""count"": ""24"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Matthew Webster""}, {""relevance"": ""0.690083"", ""count"": ""20"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Anna Alger""}, {""relevance"": ""0.162132"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""ST.

Elassal also said that he didnt want his client being lumped in with Ray, because Al-Saady isnt accused of pulling the trigger on the shot that felled Al-Uglah.</p> <p>Judge Mark Plawecki ultimately sided with the prosecution and ordered Al-Saady held without bail.</p> <p>Al-Saady and Ray allegedly went to Al-Uglahs house in the 22000 block of Brooklawn about 8:30 p.m. Sept. 14 looking to collect on the debt.</p> <p>Donning masks, the suspects entered Al-Uglah's backyard and tampered with the electrical meter to temporarily cut power to the house. When Al-Uglah went out to investigate, the men pulled out guns and forced him back inside where they robbed him, his wife and his bother at gunpoint. The couple's elementary school-aged children were home as the incident unfolded. During the course of the robbery, a struggle ensued and Ray, 19, allegedly shot Al-Uglah in the neck.

www.tctimes.com/news/do-we-live-in-a-stand-your-ground-state/article_8af52ba8-0c2e-11e3-b7a7-0019bb2963f4.html,Fenton,MI,"Do we live in a stand your ground state? - Tri-County Times: News For Fenton, Linden, Holly MI",20130827T000000,"<p>Prior to 2006, Michigan residents had a duty to retreat, meaning they had to try to escape the dangerous situation in their home before using force, which is the default common law. Im glad they changed it, said Argentine Township Police Chief Dan Allen.</p> <p>The self defense act removed the duty to retreat in what Judge Mark McCabe of the 67th District Court describes as a few narrow exceptions.</p> <p>Both Florida and Michigan statutes require the person using potentially deadly force to not be committing a crime at the time. The person must also not use the force against someone who is otherwise supposed to be there  like a person who lives in the same home.</p> <p>In either state, the person must believe that they, or someone nearby, is in imminent danger of death, great bodily harm or sexual assault, and the use of potentially deadly force is needed to stop the attack.</p> <p>The term stand your ground is not in the Michigan statute. The Florida law is titled Justifiable use of force, and is similar in size to the Michigan law.</p> <p>McCabe cant recall any specific cases where the self defense law was used or cited, but hes sure it has been discussed, but more so with misdemeanor cases.</p> <p>Det. Sgt. Julie Bemus of the Holly Police Department said in the seven years shes been in Holly, she has not seen anyone defend themselves with deadly force inside the village of Holly.</p> <p>Im glad that it hasnt happened, she said. If such a case would have occurred, she would have investigated it, and made sure the actual law was followed.</p> <p>Bemus said it wasnt their place as police officers to judge the laws themselves  just to enforce them. But then she said, I have to protect my family and I have to protect my children, and every citizen has a right to protect themselves in their home. I do the same thing at work, I protect others.</p> <p>Allen has seen a similar defense used while working with the Flint Police Department. Shop owners would use deadly force during a robbery, and although Michigan was still a duty to retreat state at the time, the shop owners could still argue self defense successfully.</p> <p>I think people should have a right to defend themselves within reason, said Allen. He said that once a person who was previously in danger, and has since gotten control of the situation has a duty to stop using that potentially deadly force.</p> <p>Allen said that police have a duty to de-escalate a situation once its under control. Police are legally allowed to use force that is one step above the threat before them  for example if an assailant has a knife, its appropriate to use firearms.</p> <p>This isnt necessarily true with regular citizens. For example, if facing an unarmed assailant in a fight, simply picking up a stick can be considered felonious assault  a four-year felony. A gun cant be brought to bear against an unarmed person in self defense, unless the other person has a great advantage physically, and they are losing a fight, potentially for their life.</p> <p>As a police officer, and self-defense instructor for decades, Allen has strong feelings about self defense and the application of the laws.</p> <p>A death of a human being is homicide, he said, whether that be justifiable homicide, or manslaughter, based on the facts of the case. If a person is killed, whether it was self-defense, the courts will look at it later. The self defense act will not immediately absolve anyone of a crime, but it will give the district attorney a reason to not bring up charges, or should a trial occur, an argument for the defense.</p> <p>Though parallels can be drawn between Florida and Michigan law, Allen said theyre not quite the same. Michigans a little different, he said. Its not Texas for sure.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.902224"", ""count"": ""9"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Chief Dan Allen""}, {""relevance"": ""0.869199"", ""count"": ""10"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.michigan.gov"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Michigan"", ""name"": ""Michigan"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.04rrx"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""PoliticalDistrict"", ""AdministrativeDivision"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction"", ""USState""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan""}, ""text"": ""Michigan""}, {""relevance"": ""0.477728"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Det.

www.houghtonlakeresorter.com/news/2013-08-29/News/Grosbeak_Blvd_to_be_mowed.html,Houghton_Lake,MI,Grosbeak Blvd. to be mowed | www.houghtonlakeresorter.com | Houghton Lake Resorter,20130829T000000,"<p>After years of discussion and court cases, the road end at Grosbeak Boulevard has been deemed a public space. With the determination, the Grosbeak Boulevard Association has requested that the area be mowed to allow for easier access.</p> <p>During a Roscommon County Road Commission meeting on Aug. 22, the board approved the RCRC staff to mow the area. The initial mow will cost $3,800 as RCRC Manager Tim ORourke said its almost impossible to traverse this area.</p> <p>The first mow will take place on Sept. 9 and an annual budget of $1,000 can be spent on mowing the area. ORourke said Gerrish Township will initially pay for the cost of mowing and then be reimbursed by the association.</p> <p>In the past, the area was moved by an association member if it was mowed at all. Member Kim Akin was concerned that the RCRC would be mowing the area.</p> <p>I dont know that thats something we want to be involved in, Akin said.</p> <p>ORourke said he was comfortable with the staff mowing the area and all five members voted in favor of the RCRC mowing Grosbeak Boulevard.</p> <p>The board addressed another road end issue as Brown Street resident Meryln Niles addressed the board on large rocks and slabs of concrete at the end of the road. Niles told the board because of the concrete at the end of the road he was having trouble figuring out the best place to position a dock as he also had questions on the roads right of way.</p> <p>Nobody wants to assist in clearing the debris, Niles said as he has also addressed the issue with Roscommon Township and the Department of Natural Resources.</p> <p>ORourke said the RCRC staff would go to the road end and determine the best way to address the built up rock and concrete. He added once the staff gets to the road they will determine if its best to break up the concrete and either reinsert the broken up rock back with the existing rock or remove whatever does not fit.</p> <p>Regarding a question of the Brown Street right of way ORourke said Roscommon Township could pay up to $500 to have posts installed indicating the perimeters of the road. ORourke told Niles it would be up to the township to determine if it wanted to pay for the posts. ORourke also told Niles the RCRC would not make a recommendation on where to place his dock as he should refer to the Roscommon Township dock ordinance.</p> <p>In other news, ORourke will be meeting with the Michigan Department of Transportation to address MDOTs desire to reduce the number of winter patrol employees from two to one person. ORourke said it isnt feasible to have only one night patrol person as Roscommon County can have varying snow patterns at the same time.</p> <p>Nobody likes this, nobody wants to have one person, ORourke said.</p> <p>ORourke also address the selling of a 3/4 ton truck to Richfield Township. He was informed by Richfield Supervisor Jim VanWormer that the township board approve the spending of up to $7,000 for the truck. ORourke said he felt it best to refuse the offer as the Kelly Blue Book value is $11,000. He added he would only accept $11,000 for the truck as it could be placed in the annual equipment auction.</p> <p>The board also passed a resolution in support of Houghton Lake resident Jack McCauleys effort to have the dredged holes of Houghton Lake marked with buoys.</p> <p>The next regular RCRC meeting will be held Sept.12 at 7 p.m.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.830277"", ""count"": ""18"",

www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/08/kettering_university_students_16.html,Ann_Arbor,MN,New Kettering University student club wants to carry concealed guns on Flint campus,20130829T060000,"<p>FLINT, MI  Some Kettering University students want to start a conversation about allowing the carrying of concealed firearms on campus.</p> <p>And they've started a club to do it.</p> <p>Kettering Students for Concealed Carry became an official university club Aug. 1, and members are taking the opportunity to get students talking.</p> <p>""We believe that while college campuses are usually safer than other public places, we still think that anything can happen,"" said Kaity Huff, KSCC vice president. ""Calling this a gun-free space won't stop a crazy person.""</p> <p>The group of roughly 20 active members out of the almost 900 students in their section wants to invite others to join the conversation.</p> <p>A group of students has been discussing similar topics since 2011, but becoming an official club allows them to reach out to more students, club officials said. They want to dispel misconceptions about concealed carry in general and on college campuses, as well as promote conversation to change policy.</p> <p>Changing policy is not to say that every student will be carrying a gun, however, Huff said. The goal is to allow those with concealed weapons permits to carry on campus, just like most public places.</p> <p>Michigan law prohibits concealed carry weapons in all classrooms and dormitories. Kettering, like almost all colleges in Michigan  except Michigan State University  extends the ban to the entire campus.</p> <p>""We recognize that university policy can't change overnight,"" Huff said. ""We really want to promote discussion.""</p> <p>Flint Mayor Dayne Walling, who is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns which aims to prevent gun violence, said he agreed with the current university policy of prohibiting firearms.</p> <p>The university has already made a determination about its policy based on safety of its students and campus, Walling said. I think each institution has the responsibility of setting policies for the public health of their staff and students.</p> <p>Even though Flint is ranked the most violent city in the nation, KSCC members say the group isnt about violence in the area. In fact, there are many reports of college campuses being safer than other public areas, the club board members said.</p> <p>They want to promote concealed carry on campus to give students, faculty and staff the right to carry concealed weapons just like other public areas and for self-defense in case something does happen. Concealed carry would be allowed only for those who have gone through the proper training to receive their Concealed Pistol License.</p> <p>KSCC stems from the national group Students for Concealed Carry, which claims more than 43,000 college students, professors, staff and citizens involved. According to the national groups website, group officials say its not fair to make concealed carry on campuses off limits just because colleges are safer places.</p> <p>The mass shooting that took place Virginia Tech in 2007 was cited as an example of what can happen even when guns are prohibited on campus.</p> <p>While it may be safe to say colleges overall are less prone to crime than national averages, these numbers are useless in determining an individuals personal vulnerability to robbery or rape, or a campus vulnerability to mass shootings, the Students for Concealed Carry website states.</p> <p>In the near future, the Flint club hopes to organize a town hall meeting with speakers from both sides of the issue and invite the campus community to join.</p> <p>""As part of the college experience, Kettering University encourages all of its students to engage in causes and issues that they are passionate about,"" said Betsy Homsher, Kettering University vice president of student life and dean of students. ""As an institution, we are always open to hearing feedback from students and we take those concerns seriously.""</p> <p>The group meets Tuesdays around noon in the Sunset Cafe inside the Campus Center. The group has seen an increase in interest and participation since becoming a club, said Dan Keys, club president.</p> <p>The Kettering Students for Concealed Carry Facebook group has more than 150 members and more people have reached out to the club, he said.</p> <p>The club hopes to not only discuss policy at Kettering but also address state and national policies.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Sept. 3, the group plans an Empty Holster Protest, in which members will walk around campus wearing empty holsters, while talking about club's position.</p> <p>""It demonstrates that when are around this campus, we are defenseless,"" said Keys, 22, of Northville.</p> <p>In general, there is often a fear of the word ""gun,"" Huff said. The group hopes to defuse the fear and educate the campus community on concealed carry laws and initiatives.</p> <p>Looking at Genesee County as a whole, the interest in Concealed Pistol Licenses (CPLs) is growing.</p> <p>The number of CPLs in Genesee County has increased steadily over the years, said Doreen Fulcher, Genesee County elections supervisor. In 2008, there were 2,405 CPL applicants. That increased to 5,083 in 2012.</p> <p>In January of this year there were 787 applications, which is up from 427 in January of 2011.</p> <p>Kettering sophomore Hunter Casbeer was a class representative for Kettering Student Government when the group proposed the idea.</p> <p>Everyones reaction was Whoa, are they wanting to get students to carry guns on campus?  said Casbeer, 20. It was sort of a shock to the people on the Senate at least.</p> <p>Their goals from what Casbeer gathered was to raise awareness and allow campus officers to carry guns, which he thought was a good idea.</p> <p>But he doesn't believe it would be a good idea to have students carry guns on campus.</p> <p>But students would be a different story. I think it would cause more trouble. I couldnt see students doing it,"" he said. I honestly couldnt see any reason for them to be carrying it. I feel like its pretty safe throughout Kettering.</p> <p>Freshman Shaun Smith, however, is in support of carrying concealed weapons on campus.</p> <p>I think it would be nice, because then people could learn to defend themselves in bad situations. Learning how to properly handle a gun is a good idea, in my opinion,"" Smith said.</p> <p>The group also hopes to host classes where experts talk about firearm safety, safety tips and the law.</p> <p>Not everyone in Kettering Students for Concealed Carry has their CPL, but they all have interest in discussing policy change.</p> <p>""Why should you feel any different on a college campus than in public?"" asked Blaise Friery, a member of the KSCC.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.993678"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""disambiguated"": {""freebase"":

www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/10/petition_drive_seeks_criminal.html,Ann_Arbor,MN,Petition drive seeks criminal charges against man who stopped alleged purse snatcher,20131001T120600,"<p>GRAND RAPIDS, MI  While many hail as a hero the man shown on video pinning down an alleged purse snatcher on the eve of ArtPrize, there is a group of people who have signed an online petition to have the man criminally charged.</p> <p>Local activist Robert Muhammad says he believes Jonathan Damon went too far on Sept. 17 when he delivered three punches to 24-year-old Mikayla Hull as he straddled the struggling woman and held her arms down until authorities arrived.</p> <p>In the event, captured by MLive and The Grand Rapids Press on video, another man grabs Damons arm, stopping the punching. Damon says Hull was biting him.</p> <p>Damon, an attorney based not far from where the incident occurred, says he later received medical treatment for the bite that included a tetanus shot and a prescription for antibiotics.</p> <p>Damon was one of a handful of people who grabbed Hull after she allegedly stole the purse from a 75-year-old woman and tried to get away on her bike along Ottawa Avenue NW near the Grand Rapids Art Museum.</p> <p>Hull has since been charged with aggravated assault and larceny.</p> <p>Damon has not been charged because police determined his actions were justified.</p> <p>But some do not agree and have started an online petition demanding the Kent County Prosecutor take action.</p> <p>The petition, posted at Change.org ,had 200 online signatures as of Tuesday, Oct. 1.</p> <p>The posting urges people to sign and describes the incident, but does not mention the alleged biting.</p> <p>During the arrest her arms and legs were held on the ground while a 250 lb. man (Jonathan Damon) sat on her chest, the petition reads. After pleading with him to let her up, she attempted to free herself and was punched in the face three times by Mr. Damon before one of the other men stopped him (on video).</p> <p>We believe that this sets a dangerous precedent, as it regards citizens' arrests and especially women's rights, in cases where men may attempt to arrest and detain women.  This case should be carefully investigated and Mr. Damon should be prosecuted for his abuse of this young lady.</p> <p>In response to the petition, several who signed mention the controversial Florida prosecution of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.</p> <p>The petition was initiated by 39-year-old Muhammad, who says he does not know anyone involved, but was moved to start the petition after seeing the video on MLive and seeing the comments following the online article.</p> <p>It disturbed me that so many looked at it and saw nothing wrong with it, said Muhammad, an engineering technician. ""Even if she committed a crime, she still has human rights.</p> <p>Kent County Commissioner Candace Chivis, D-Grand Rapids, wrote a letter to Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth expressing her concerns.</p> <p>In my opinion, after having viewed the video twice, I do feel that the lawyer was in the wrong and you can clearly see that he is enjoying hitting the woman and he was probably not detaining her correctly and that's why she bit him,"" Chivis wrote in an email to Forsyth.</p> <p>You can also see that only because another guy steps in and stops him from hitting her does he stop. But, as far as I can see, all of that is just very disturbing and not illegal, Chivis wrote. I am not sticking up for the purse-snatcher, I am just wondering what actually constitutes assault regarding a citizen's arrest.</p> <p>Forsyth said he has no plans to prosecute Damon, whom he said was completely justified in his actions.</p> <p>I hate to disappoint them, Forsyth said. They can bring the petition here, but it wont result in a prosecution.</p> <p>Forsyth said if anything, Damon should be commended for doing more than just standing by and watching as a crime occurs.</p> <p>Why she bit him and what his feelings were at the time he hit her are speculative and have no bearing on my decision not to prosecute him for his actions, Forsyth said.</p> <p>Forsyth said it is clear that Damon is stopping the woman from injuring him.</p> <p>Somehow, Im supposed to prosecute him for that? Forsyth said. Im not charging him with anything.</p> <p>Chivis said she is satisfied from a legal standpoint that Damon could not be prosecuted.</p> <p>I think there should be clearer rules for what can be done in a citizens arrest, Chivis said. I think he should be told by law enforcement that what he did was wrong. But I think that legally, Prosecutor Forsyth was right. There's very little legal recourse because she was committing a felony and he was detaining her.</p> <p>Muhammad said he sees Forsyths response as symptomatic of American society.</p> <p>Im not surprised or shocked by (Forsyths) response, There are some class lines and racial lines that impact how we see this.</p> <p>E-mail Barton Deiters: bdeiters@mlive.com and follow him on Twitter at

www.crookstontimes.com/article/20131001/NEWS/310019971/1664/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE,Crookston,MN,"TV Guide - Today's News: Our Take - ""Heroes"" Worship: How DC Comics and Arrow Are Doing Good - News - Crookston Times - Crookston, MN - Crookston, MN",20131001T000000,"<p>Between the Dark Knight films, Teen Titans Go!, and the Amell-icousness of Arrow, DC Comics and DC Entertainment have given us a lot to be happy about lately. Now they're giving fans the chance to score some sweet, once-in-a-lifetime goodies and do some serious good with ""We Can Be Heroes,"" the comic-book empire's ongoing charity-giving campaign benefiting hunger-relief groups in the Horn of Africa. Built around members of the Justice League, each week in this latest leg of the WCBH push features perks like set visits, signed books and other awesome swag, all up for grabs to goodhearted folks who donate to the cause. Here, DC Comics creative chief officer Geoff Johns, and Arrow executive producers Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg explain the campaign and how TV's hottest hooded vigilante factors in to the philanthropy this week.</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: Where did the ""We Can Be Heroes"" concept come from, and why focus on the hunger crisis in Africa?Geoff Johns: The world's greatest super heroes form the Justice League - and the values these iconic heroes hold have always been aspirational and inspirational. That's why we love super heroes: They provide a powerful message of hope, optimism and action to people. And because of that, the Justice League is helping us shine a light on the ""We Can Be Heroes"" campaign and asking people to go into action with them. The campaign's been rallying fans to join forces with the creators who bring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg to life across film, television, video games, animation and comic books.</p> <p>The focus of this phase of the campaign is on fighting the hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa. Although 13 million men, women and children in the region were suffering the effects of the worst drought and famine seen by the region in over 60 years, the humanitarian crisis was under-reported and underfunded. DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. stepped up to become the first corporation to commit funds and support for the cause - something that makes me incredibly proud to be a part of this company.</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: What are the funds raised by WCBH used for?Johns: All net proceeds from funds raised go to our three humanitarian-aid partners: Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee, and Mercy Corps. Each of these organizations has been working on the ground since the hunger crisis started.</p> <p>Page 2 of 3 - TV Guide Magazine: How can fans contribute? Is it as easy as just donating on Indiegogo?Johns: Yes. Our fans are already using Indiegogo to support a variety of projects, so we decided to meet them where they are. We also knew that we had the incentives or ""perks,"" as they're known on Indiegogo, that fans wanted, and that they could help encourage them to make multiple donations to support the campaign. We believed that things like signed DVDs, popular comic books with variant covers, limited edition lithographs and unique fan experiences with talent would help raise a lot of money to bring help and hope to the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: Is it DC's plan to incorporate any of this philanthropy into the comics?Johns: We took popular comic book titles and created unique artwork like variant covers or lithographs specifically for ""We Can Be Heroes."" Our creators donated their time and signed, numbered and customized a variety of items, not just comic books, but also e-readers. They've also volunteered to hang out with fans at big events like San Diego Comic-Con. We treated fans who supported the campaign like VIPs and gave them behind-the-scenes access. Anything we can do to return the favor of being part of ""We Can Be Heroes"" we are trying to do.</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: How did you decide which perks would come with each member of the Justice League?Johns: We want the perks to appeal not only to our core fans, but to other audiences that come to know our superheroes outside of comic books, like the Arrow television series on The CW, and through movies like Man of Steel and The Dark Knight. So we worked with our friends within Warner Bros. to bring items like advance screenings and experiences like set visits to the mix to help bring in large donations for the campaign. For example, we just finished the Wonder Woman-themed week and those perks included a Lynda Carter experience and various signed Wonder Woman comics. I was hoping to win that one myself!</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: This week's hero theme includes Green Arrow, and the perk a contributor could win is an advance screening party of an upcoming Arrow episode...do you know which one?Johns: The advance screening will definitely take place during the upcoming season, although the specific episode is TBD. But trust me, you do not want to miss this season. #BlackCanary</p> <p>TV Guide Magazine: On the topic of Arrow, Season 2 starts soon and you have a flood of DC characters coming in. What is the process of getting the OK from DC to use characters like Black Canary and the Flash, who are both heading to the show?Marc Guggenheim: For the most part, it's a simple matter of calling or emailing our friends at DC, like Geoff or [editor] Pornsak Pichetshote. Depending on the profile or recognizability of the character, it's as simple as an email exchange. Some characters require a longer discussion. But DC is always incredibly supportive and encouraging. And at the beginning of each season, they actually make suggestions as to which characters we might want to use. For example, they suggested Bronze Tiger, who appears in Episode 2 of the season.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.810063"", ""count"": ""7"", ""type"": ""PrintMedia"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"":

LOUIS  Undercover work requires luck as well as skill, and a federal agent here used up a lifetimes worth when two men buying guns and drugs opened fire inside a car. That is, they tried to open fire. Both their weapons failed, allowing the agent and two informers to escape with their lives last week, officials and court documents revealed.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors charged Frederick Freaky Crayton, 23, and James J. Blood Jones, 21, with assault on a federal law enforcement officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon. Prosecutors asked Monday that they be held without bail pending trial. A judge will decide later.</p> <p>On Wednesday more charges were added against Crayton, Jones and another man, Dwayne Crayton, 24. They all face multiple federal gun and drug charges.</p> <p>Frederick Crayton is from St. Louis; Jones' home community was not available.</p> <p>The agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was pistol-whipped in the ensuing fight. ATF spokeswoman Trista Frederick said Monday that the agent was doing fine. The officers name was not revealed by the agency or in court records.</p> <p>Frederick could not explain how both guns malfunctioned at the same time. She did say that ATF had neither provided the weapons nor tampered with them.</p> <p>Sometimes things just work out better for us than for them, she explained.</p> <p>Authorities said the guns were semi-automatic pistols, one a .40 caliber and one a 9 millimeter.</p> <p>Daniel E. Jackson, a retired St. Louis County police firearms examiner who now serves as a forensic consultant, said Monday that while it was weird for both weapons to misfire repeatedly, it is not unusual for a street gun to fail.</p> <p>There are frequently, frequently bad guys running around out there with guns that dont work, Jackson said. Many guns are abused, and bought and sold cheaply on the street, he said. Im just amazed that most of them dont end up in a gunfight and find out the hard way.</p> <p>According to an affidavit filed in court by Special Agent Russell G. Johnson, one of the investigators, the undercover agent and the gunmen had had dealings before. The agent first met with them and another man to sell a gun to one of them, Johnson wrote. They met again April 15, and another man sold the agent and the informants crack cocaine. The third meeting was Thursday, in the 3200 block of Henrietta Place, just northeast of Interstate 44 and Grand Boulevard.</p> <p>The sellers pulled handguns, prompting a scuffle inside the car, officials said. The men pulled their triggers over and over but the pistols would not fire.The agent was struck with a gun, splitting (the agents) head open, the affidavit says. The fight then spilled out of the car. Witnesses saw the men point their guns and pull the triggers again, accompanied by more harmless clicking.</p> <p>The attackers ran off, only to be caught  with their guns  by other officers nearby.</p> <p>U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan said, Obviously, this is a situation that could have ended tragically. It just underscores the ... day-to-day danger that law enforcement faces and what you may encounter in these undercover investigations, he said. Speaking of Jones and Frederick Crayton, Callahan said, In their mind, they were going to rip them off.</p> <p>In court Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Toni Decker told U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Mummert the defendants were a danger to the community. If that gun had not misfired, we would probably be talking about a dead federal agent, she said. Mummert took the request under advisement.Decker said both men will probably be indicted on Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>Court records show this is the first time either man has faced a federal charge.</p> <p>In 1998, Frederick Crayton was convicted of burglary and theft in St. Louis County. In 2011, he was convicted of misdemeanor property damage in St. Louis.</p> <p>Frederick Craytons public defender, Sean Vicente, said his client had served minor sentences on both his prior cases. He said Crayton had worked at a diner until it closed.</p> <p>Vicente pointed out that Jones was the one accused of pistol-whipping the agent.</p> <p>Vicente noted, I dont know what to say about the faulty guns.</p> <p>Jones attorney, Peter Cohen, said his client was a self-employed tuckpointer whose only prior criminal case was a misdemeanor assault on a law enforcement officer at the age of 19. Cohen asked for Jones to be released on house arrest.</p> <p>Neither lawyer commented outside the courtroom Monday. Decker referred questions to Callahan.</p> <p>A mug shot of Jones was not available.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.81936"", ""count"": ""9"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Frederick Crayton""}, {""relevance"": ""0.495687"", ""count"": ""8"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Jones""}, {""relevance"": ""0.425666"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""FieldTerminology"", ""text"": ""Federal prosecutors""}, {""relevance"": ""0.388905"", ""count"": ""5"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Trista Frederick""}, {""relevance"": ""0.353423"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Richard_Callaghan"", ""subType"": [], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Callaghan"", ""name"": ""Richard Callaghan"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.07f6vd""}, ""text"": ""Attorney Richard Callahan""}, {""relevance"": ""0.333701"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""ST.

www.clarionledger.com/usatoday/article/2695243,Jackson,MS,Syria warns U.S. not to intervene militarily | The Clarion-Ledger | clarionledger.com,20130825T000000,"<p>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) - The Syrian government accused rebels of using chemical weapons Saturday and warned the United States not to launch any military action against Damascus over an alleged chemical attack last week, saying such a move would set the Middle East ablaze.</p> <p>The accusations by the regime of President Bashar Assad against opposition forces came as an international aid group said it has tallied 355 deaths from a purported chemical weapons attack on Wednesday in a suburb of the Syrian capital known as Ghouta.</p> <p>Syria is intertwined in alliances with Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and Palestinian militant groups. The country also borders its longtime foe and U.S. ally Israel, making the fallout from military action unpredictable.</p> <p>Violence in Syria has already spilled over the past year to Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Battle-hardened Hezbollah fighters have joined the combat alongside Assad's forces.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters Sunday in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, U.S. Defense Secretary Hagel declined to say what action the U.S. might take. He said the administration is weighing many factors. These include an intelligence assessment of the attack in Syria, as well as what he called legal issues and the matter of international support for any military response.</p> <p>Meanwhile, U.S. naval units are moving closer to Syria. U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea but without immediate orders for any missile launch into Syria. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly.</p> <p>President Obama has emphasized that a quick intervention in the Syrian civil war was problematic, given the international considerations that should precede a military strike.</p> <p>After Obama met with his national security team Saturday, the White House said U.S. intelligence officials are still trying to determine whether Assad's government unleashed the chemical weapons attack earlier this week.</p> <p>The White House statement said Obama received a detailed review of the range of options he has requested for the U.S. and the international community to respond if it is determined that Assad has engaged in deadly chemical warfare.</p> <p>Obama spoke by telephone with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Syria, the White House said.</p> <p>A statement from Cameron's office at No. 10 Downing St. said the prime minister and Obama are concerned by ""increasing signs"" that ""a significant chemical weapons attack"" was carried out by the Syrian government against its people. Obama and Cameron ""reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community,"" according to the statement.</p> <p>Syria's Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi dismissed the possibility of an American attack, warning that such a move would risk triggering more violence in the region.</p> <p>""The basic repercussion would be a ball of fire that would burn not only Syria but the whole Middle East,"" al-Zoubi said in an interview with Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV. ""An attack on Syria would be no easy trip.""</p> <p>In Tehran, Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Abbas Arakji, warned that an American military intervention in Syria will ""complicate matters.""</p> <p>""Sending warships will not solve the problems but will worsen the situation,"" Arakji said in comments carried by Iran's Arabic-language TV Al-Alam. He added that any such U.S. move does not have international backing and that Iran ""rejects military solutions.""</p> <p>In France, Doctors Without Borders said three hospitals it supports in the eastern Damascus region reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms"" over less than three hours on Wednesday morning, when the attack in the eastern Ghouta area took place.</p> <p>Of those, 355 died, the Paris-based group said.</p> <p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday that its estimated death toll from the alleged chemical attack had reached 322, including 54 children, 82 women and dozens of fighters. It said the dead included 16 people who have not been identified.</p> <p>The group said it raised its death toll from an earlier figure of 136, which had been calculated before its activists in the stricken areas met doctors, residents and saw medical reports. It said the dead ""fell in the massacre committed by the Syrian regime.""</p> <p>Death tolls have varied wildly over the alleged attack, with Syrian anti-government activists reporting between 322 and 1,300 killed.</p> <p>Al-Zoubi blamed the rebels for the chemical attacks in Ghouta, saying that the Syrian government had proof of their responsibility but without giving details. ""The rockets were fired from their positions and fell on civilians. They are responsible,"" he said.</p> <p>With the pressure increasing, Syria's state media accused rebels in the contested district of Jobar near Damascus of using chemical weapons against government troops Saturday.</p> <p>State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs, gas masks, vials of an unspecified medication, explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts Saturday.</p> <p>One barrel had ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on it. The TV report also showed medicines said to be produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are strong supporters of the Syrian rebels. The report could not be immediately verified.</p> <p>An army statement issued late Saturday said the discovery of the weapons ""is clear evidence that these gangs are using chemical weapons against our people and soldiers with help from foreign sides.""</p> <p>The claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for Wednesday's alleged gas attack, which spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were used.</p> <p>Just hours before the state media reports, the U.N. disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press Assad's regime to allow U.N. experts to investigate the alleged Wednesday attack. The regime has denied allegations it was responsible, calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government.</p> <p>The U.S., Britain, France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. The U.N. secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane, the high representative for disarmament affairs, to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesday's purported attack. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday.</p> <p>The state news agency said several government troops who took part in the Jobar offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation,"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops.</p> <p>""The Syrian Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason, the terrorist groups used chemical weapons as their last card,"" state TV said. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists.""</p> <p>State TV also broadcast images of a Syrian army officer, wearing a surgical mask, telling reporters wearing similar masks that soldiers were subjected to poisonous attack in Jobar. He spoke inside the depot where the alleged confiscated products were placed.</p> <p>""Our troops did not suffer body wounds,"" the officer said. ""I believe terrorist groups used special substances that are poisonous in an attempt to affect this advance.""</p> <p>Al-Mayadeen aired interviews with two soldiers hospitalized for possible chemical weapons attack. The two appeared unharmed but were undergoing tests.</p> <p>""We were advancing and heard an explosion that was not very strong,"" a soldier said from his bed. ""Then there was a strange smell, my eyes and head ached and I struggled to breathe."" The other soldier also said he experienced trouble breathing after the explosion.</p> <p>Al-Mayadeen TV, which has a reporter embedded with the troops in the area, said some 50 soldiers were rushed to Damascus hospitals for treatment and that it was not yet known what type of gas the troops were subjected too.</p> <p>In Turkey, top Syrian rebel commander Salim Idris told reporters that opposition forces did not use chemical weapons on Saturday and that ""the regime is lying.""</p> <p>For days, the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used chemical weapons on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus, arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack.</p> <p>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius dismissed the Syrian government's claims.</p> <p>""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in Syria, near Damascus, and that Bashar Assad's regime was behind it,"" Fabius told reporters during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate.</p> <p>France has suggested that force could be used against Syria if Assad's regime was proven to have used chemical arms.</p> <p>The new talk of potential military action in in the country has made an independent investigation by U.N. inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired.</p> <p>The U.N. experts already in Syria are tasked with investigating three earlier purported chemical attacks in the country: one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March, as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons.</p> <p>It took months of negotiations between the U.N. and Damascus before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into Syria to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites, however, and it is only charged with determining whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.</p> <p>Leaders of the main Western-backed Syrian opposition group on Saturday vowed retaliation for the alleged chemical weapons attack.</p> <p>From Istanbul, the head of the Syrian National Coalition, Ahmad Al-Jarba, also criticized the lack of response to the attack by the United Nations and the international community, saying the UN was discrediting itself.</p> <p>""It does not reach the ethical and legal response that Syrians expect,"" he said. ""As a matter of fact we can describe it as a shame.""</p> <p>Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All   rights reserved.

But that charge was dismissed after District Judge James Reynolds ruled that certain evidence, namely the windshield of Temples truck and a blood sample of the police officer, was mishandled, possibly hindering Temples defense.</p> <p>But other charges remained, namely a felony count of theft related to silver coins. Hes also charged with felony possession of drugs for OxyContin residue prosecutors say was found later in his truck, as well as possession of drug paraphernalia and obstructing a peace officer, both misdemeanors.</p> <p>Deputy County Attorney Melissa Broch did not mention the shooting in her opening statement Tuesday to the seven-man, five-woman jury, but outlined a scheme of stealing silver coins and pawning them, which she said netted Temple about $2,000.</p> <p>She said testimony would show that on April 27, 2011, Temple sold 16 silver dollars  in a condition such that they were valuable for their silver content, not their rarity or collectability  to Wayne Miller Coins on Last Chance Gulch for $432.</p> <p>But something didnt sit right with Wayne Miller, she said. He thought hed bought his own coins back.</p> <p>Miller had his son, John, review the stores surveillance footage, Broch said, and it showed that Temple had taken coins on multiple occasions from a box on the counter. He also reached behind the counter and apparently took something, she said.</p> <p>Miller reported the matter to police, who learned from a review of pawn shop slips that Temple had sold coins on four occasions to Daves Pawn, a few blocks away, for a total of about $2,000.</p> <p>On May 4, 2011, a Helena police officer tried to question Temple, but he fled the scene. Temple was shot in the chest during the pursuit  authorities said he was driving at the officer  and drove himself to St. Peters Hospital.</p> <p>Broch said Tuesday a search of his truck turned up a bag of coins as well as a drug kit consisting of a tourniquet, syringe, spoon and pill crusher. The spoon was found to have drug residue, and DNA found on the syringe was consistent with Temples, she said.</p> <p>The trial could run through Thursday.</p> <p>David Freedman of Miles City, Temples lawyer, declined to make his opening statement until after the prosecution presents its case.</p> <p>If convicted, Temple, 38, could face 10 years in prison for the theft and five years for the drug charge.</p> <p>Any penalty could be stacked onto the five-year prison sentence Temple received in January by a Ravalli County judge for violating the terms of his probation.

The state Medical Examiner's office confirmed the findings the next day, saying in an affidavit that Worley was stabbed with an 8-inch butcher knife and that one of the wounds had punctured a lung.</p> <p>The medical examiner's office said the stab wound was the cause of Worley's death, as it would have caused Worley to lose control of his motor skills within an hour, according to the affidavit.</p> <p>The N.C.

The patrol said Worley's vehicle, traveling about 90 mph, overturned several times, struck another ditch culvert and came to rest in its top.</p> <p>Worley wasn't wearing a seat belt and was thrown from the vehicle, according to the patrol. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>Talley is being held in the Harnett County Detention Center under $200,000 bail.

Winston-Salem Police Chief Barry Rountree told a news conference that the school was conducting a scheduled fire drill at the time and that students were returning to the buildings rear entrance when the shooting occurred.</p> <p>Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools spokesman Theo Helm said 25-year veteran Winston-Salem police officer Tim Wilson, who is the schools resource officer, was near the scene of the shooting and took the suspect into custody without incident.

www.kinston.com/news/web-exclusives/gunman-killed-near-n-c-campus-1.207528?ot=hmg.PrintPageLayout.ot&print=photo,Kinston,NC,Print - Web Exclusives,20130924T085700,"<p>AP</p> <p>An armed man pursued onto the campus of North Carolina Central University was shot and killed in nearby woods after challenging officers, police said Tuesday.</p> <p>Durham police tracked the suspect onto the campus late Monday, prompting officials to lock down the school for several hours. It was not immediately clear why Durham police had pursued the man. He was subsequently found in some woods southeast of the university campus before midnight. The man challenged three officers with a gun and they fired in response, campus Police Chief Timothy Bellamy said.</p> <p>The man's name was not immediately released. Police said he was not a student. There were no injuries reported to others and a campus lockdown that began at 10:15 p.m. Monday was lifted shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday. The officers have been placed on administrative leave while the State Bureau of Investigation reviews the shooting.</p> <p>A school spokeswoman did not immediately respond to messages early Tuesday.

www.northjersey.com/news/Obama_set_to_speak_on_Syria_at_White_House.html,Hackensack,NJ,"In reversal, Obama to give Congress a say on Syria action",20130831T000000,"<p>WASHINGTON  Short on support at home and allies abroad, President Obama unexpectedly took a step back from his plan to attack Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons by asking Congress for its support in launching such a strike.</p> <p>Obama said he had decided the United States should take military action and that he believes that as commander in chief, he has the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization.</p> <p>At the same time, he said, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective.</p> <p>The White House would not say what options would still be open to the president if he fails to win the backing of the House and Senate for the military measures he has threatened.</p> <p>House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he expected the House to consider the measure the week of Sept. 9. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he, too, will hold a vote no later than the week of Sept. 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, headed by New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, will begin hearings on the matter Tuesday.</p> <p>In anticipation of the coming debate, Obama challenged lawmakers to consider what message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price.</p> <p>Members of Congress, abruptly handed exactly the war powers many had demanded, grappled with whether to sign off on Obamas plan. Now with a stake in the nations global credibility, lawmakers were seeking more information about the possible consequences of striking a region without knowing what would happen next.</p> <p>The president didnt say so, but his strategy carries enormous risks to his and the nations credibility, which the administration has argued forcefully is on the line in Syria. Obama long ago said the use of chemical weapons was a red line that Assad would not be allowed to cross with impunity.</p> <p>Last week, British Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating defeat when the House of Commons refused to support his call for military action against Syria.</p> <p>Halfway around the world, Syrians awoke Saturday to state television broadcasts of tanks, planes and other weapons of war, and troops training, all to a soundtrack of martial music. Assads government blames rebels in the Aug. 21 attack and has threatened retaliation if attacked.</p> <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he was appealing to a Nobel Peace laureate rather than to a president, urged Obama to reconsider. A group that monitors casualties in the long Syrian civil war challenged the United States to substantiate its claim that 1,429 died in a chemical weapons attack, including more than 400 children.</p> <p>By accident or design, the new timetable gives time for U.N. inspectors to receive lab results from the samples they took during four days in Damascus, and to compile a final report. After leaving Syria overnight, the inspection team arrived in Rotterdam a few hours before Obama spoke.</p> <p>The groups leader was expected to brief Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today.</p> <p>Administration officials said Obama appeared set on ordering a strike until Friday evening. After a long walk in near 90-degree temperatures around the White House grounds with chief of staff Denis McDonough, the president told his aide he had changed his mind.</p> <p>These officials said Obama initially drew resistance in a two-hour session attended by Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Klapper, CIA Director John Brennan, national security adviser Susan Rice and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco. They declined to say which of the participants had argued against Obamas proposal.</p> <p>Whatever Congress ultimately decides, the developments marked a stunning turn.</p> <p>France is Obamas only major foreign ally for a strike, public polling shows support is lukewarm in the United States and dozens of lawmakers in both parties have signed a letter urging Obama not to act without their backing. Outside the gates of the White House, the chants of protesters could be heard as the president stepped to a lectern set up in the Rose Garden.</p> <p>Had he gone ahead with a military strike, Obama would have become the first U.S. leader in three decades to attack a foreign nation without mustering broad international support or acting in direct defense of Americans. Not since 1983, when President Ronald Reagan ordered an invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada, has the U.S. been so alone in pursuing major lethal military action beyond a few attacks responding to strikes or threats against its citizens.</p> <p>Republicans generally expressed satisfaction at Obamas decision to seek congressional support and challenged him to make his case to the public and lawmakers alike that American power should be used to punish Assad.</p> <p>We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised, Boehner and other House Republican leaders said in a joint statement.</p> <p>In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of Sept. 9. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.</p> <p>New York Republican Rep. Peter King was among the dissenters, strongly so. President Obama is abdicating his responsibility as commander in chief and undermining the authority of future presidents, he said. The president doesnt need 535 members of Congress to enforce his own red line.</p> <p>Obama said Friday he was considering limited and narrow steps to punish Assad, adding that U.S. national security interests were at stake.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.878879"", ""count"": ""16"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.whitehouse.gov/"", ""yago"":

www.courierpostonline.com/usatoday/article/2750787,Cherry_Hill,NJ,Obama battles ghosts of Iraq as he ponders Syria strike | Courier-Post | courierpostonline.com,20130831T000000,"<p>WASHINGTON - In October 2002, more than five months before the U.S. would invade Iraq, an Illinois state senator named Barack Obama said at an anti-war rally that he was not against all wars, just ""dumb war.""</p> <p>Obama, who later made ending the war in Iraq a critical plank in his presidential campaign, would later go on to lament that the U.S. made a crucial mistake when it bypassed the United Nations and went to war despite skepticism in much of western Europe.</p> <p>A decade after the U.S. military started the Iraq campaign with a shock-and-awe air assault,  Obama finds himself battling with the ghosts of Iraq as he tries to win support from a skeptical Congress and a war-weary public for a punitive military strike against the Bashar Assad regime for allegedly carrying out a chemical strike in a rebel stronghold outside of Damascus that left over 1,400 dead.</p> <p>Obama alluded to his own criticism of the George W. Bush administration's failure to win broad international support before taking action in Iraq on Friday,  noting that ""I've shown consistently and said consistently my strong preference for multilateral action whenever possible.""</p> <p>""But it is not in the national security interests of the United States to ignore clear violations of these kinds of international norms,"" added Obama, whose national security team will take another attempt at nudging doubters when it holds a briefing on its Syria intelligence on Saturday.</p> <p>The Obama administration has chafed at comparisons between the Syria crisis and the war in Iraq. Obama has repeatedly made clear that he is not considering putting U.S. troops on the ground in Syria and that any potential military action would be limited in time and scope. And although Obama supports the end of Assad's rule in Syria, the White House has made clear the objective of any potential U.S. action does not include regime change.</p> <p>""I think that there are some very important differences,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said about the comparisons. ""What we saw in that circumstance was an administration that was searching high and low to produce evidence to justify a military invasion, an open-ended military invasion of another country, with the final goal being regime change.""</p> <p>Central to Obama's criticism of Bush's push for war in Iraq was that Saddam Hussein posed ""no imminent and direct threat to the United States or to his neighbors.""</p> <p>In arguing for action against the Assad regime, Obama and his aides have made the case that failure to punish Assad for something as out-of-step with international norms as a large-scale chemical attack would undermine U.S. credibility and embolden rogue states, such as  North Korea and Iran, in their own calculations.</p> <p>Obama tapped Secretary of State John Kerry to announce the release of the U.S. intelligence assessment of Syria's chemical weapon use. Kerry offered an impassioned performance that in some ways echoed then-secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations that U.S. intelligence officials had assessed with ""high confidence"" that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, a claim that proved to be false.</p> <p>Like Powell, Kerry used the term ""high confidence"" to describe the U.S. intelligence on Syria.</p> <p>Kerry has his own scars from the Iraq War. As a senator, Kerry voted in favor of going to war in Iraq before souring on the Bush administration's handling of the conflict. In Kerry's unsuccessful run for the White House in 2004, the Bush campaign effectively branded Kerry as flip-flopping on the issue, even as the American public's support for fighting in Iraq began to ebb.</p> <p>In making his case to the public that military action was necessary, he sounded cognizant of the ghosts of Iraq.</p> <p>""Now, we know that after a decade of conflict, the American people are tired of war,"" Kerry said. ""Believe me, I am, too. But fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility.""</p> <p>Copyright 2014   USATODAY.com</p> <p>Read the original story: Obama battles ghosts of Iraq as he ponders Syria strike</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.886615"", ""count"": ""17"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.whitehouse.gov/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Barack_Obama"", ""name"": ""Barack Obama"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.02mjmr"", ""subType"": [""Politician"", ""President"", ""Appointer"", ""AwardWinner"", ""Celebrity"", ""PoliticalAppointer"", ""U.S.Congressperson"", ""USPresident"", ""TVActor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barack_Obama""}, ""text"": ""Barack Obama""}, {""relevance"": ""0.864435"", ""count"": ""13"", ""type"": ""Country"", ""disambiguated"": {""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01h99z"", ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq_under_U.S._Military_Occupation"", ""name"": ""Iraq under U.S. Military Occupation""}, ""text"": ""Iraq""}, {""relevance"": ""0.457983"", ""count"": ""11"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://kerry.senate.gov/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/John_Kerry"", ""name"": ""John Kerry"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0d3qd0"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rcH5edCzTQdiF08l3bo1XFw"", ""subType"": [""Politician"", ""AwardWinner"", ""MilitaryPerson"", ""U.S.Congressperson"", ""TVActor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kerry""}, ""text"": ""John Kerry""}, {""relevance"": ""0.452651"", ""count"": ""7"", ""type"": ""Country"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.mshtawy.com"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Syria"", ""name"": ""Syria"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.06vbd"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvVj7c5wpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syria"", ""ciaFactbook"": ""http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/factbook/resource/Syria""}, ""text"": ""Syria""}, {""relevance"": ""0.449334"", ""count"": ""11"", ""type"": ""Country"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.usa.gov/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/United_States"", ""name"": ""United States"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.09c7w0"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvVikKpwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""Region"", ""AdministrativeDivision"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction"", ""FilmEditor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"", ""ciaFactbook"": ""http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/factbook/resource/United_States""}, ""text"": ""United States""}, {""relevance"": ""0.336769"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.presidentassad.net"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Bashar_al-Assad"", ""name"": ""Bashar al-Assad"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01_vwx"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rRclCglOFQdmNjOkqTkUMeA"", ""subType"": [""Physician"", ""Politician"", ""President""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bashar_al-Assad""}, ""text"": ""Bashar Assad""}, {""relevance"": ""0.330952"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""text"": ""Obama administration""}, {""relevance"": ""0.230125"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.unitedfuckingnations.com/"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0dmsjxq"", ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_(band)"", ""name"": ""United Nations (band)""}, ""text"": ""United Nations""}, {""relevance"": ""0.227019"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Facility"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.whitehouse.gov"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/White_House"", ""name"": ""White House"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.081sq"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvyXliZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""House"", ""TouristAttraction"", ""Building""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/White_House""}, ""text"": ""White House""}, {""relevance"": ""0.221959"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""senator""}, {""relevance"": ""0.210702"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""text"": ""George W.

www.northjersey.com/news/Lawyer_North_Carolina_officer_was_justified_in_shooting_unarmed_man.html,Hackensack,NJ,911 tape released in fatal North Carolina police shooting,20130917T142100,"<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C.   A sobbing woman pleads for police to ""please hurry"" because a man was breaking into her front door during a 911 call recorded moments before a responding officer shot and killed the unarmed man outside.</p> <p>The unidentified woman kept repeating ""Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"" throughout the call, which was released Tuesday. She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. Later, she said the man knocked on her door and ""he's in my front yard yelling.""</p> <p>Authorities said Jonathan A. Ferrell was shot 10 times by a Charlotte-Mecklenburg officer after being involved in a single-car wreck. Police have said Ferrell may have been seeking help and made no verbal threats to the woman.</p> <p>Officer Randall Kerrick is charged with voluntary manslaughter. His lawyers were in court Tuesday for a first appearance on the charge. Kerrick, 27, did not attend. The judge scheduled an Oct. 7 probable cause hearing for Kerrick.</p> <p>After the hearing, defense attorney Michael Greene declined to take questions but said of Kerrick: ""His actions were justified on the night in question.""</p> <p>Ferrell family attorney Chris Chestnut disagreed, saying he watched a video of the shooting recorded by a dash cam on one of the patrol cars. Chestnut said the tape shows that Kerrick fired four shots, then paused. Moments later, the officer fired six more rounds and paused again before firing the last two shots.</p> <p>""This is clearly a criminal shooting,"" he told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg police refused the AP's request to release the tape, saying it was part of an ongoing criminal investigation.</p> <p>Kerrick joined the police force in April 2011 after working as an animal control officer. He grew up in nearby Cabarrus County.</p> <p>Kerrick and two other officers responding to the breaking and entering call found Ferrell on a road that only leads to the neighborhood's pool. Ferrell ran toward the officers, who tried to stop him with a Taser. Police said he continued to run toward them and Kerrick fired 12 shots, hitting Ferrell with all but two. Ferrell died at the scene.</p> <p>Chestnut and representatives of the NAACP have questioned whether race played a role in the shooting. Ferrell is black, while Kerrick is white. Though there was praise for police for quickly filing charges, some said the shooting didn't surprise them, considering portrayals of black men in popular culture and previous instances of racially inflected violence</p> <p>On the 911 tape released by the city, the woman tells a dispatcher that she thought her husband had returned home around 2:30 a.m. But when she opened the door, a man tried to get in.</p> <p>Sobbing and trying to catch her breath, the woman asked the dispatcher: ""Where are the cops?""</p> <p>The dispatcher tried to calm her down, repeating over and over that they were on the way.</p> <p>He also asked her to describe the man. She told him he was black, about 210 pounds and wearing a green shirt.</p> <p>At one point, the woman told the dispatcher about her baby. ""He's in his bed. I don't know what to do. I can't believe I opened the door...Please don't let him get my baby,"" she cried.</p> <p>When police arrived at the scene, she peeked out her window. And when the officers began looking for a man, the dispatcher assured the woman they weren't leaving.</p> <p>On Monday, Ferrell's family said in their first public remarks in the case that the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer, they said. He had no criminal record.</p> <p>The encounter was set in motion around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when Ferrell's car ran off the entrance road to a suburban neighborhood about 15 miles from downtown Charlotte.</p> <p>After crashing his car into trees, Ferrell kicked out the back window and headed up a hill to the first set of closely-clustered houses he could see. He then started ""banging on the door viciously"" of a home to attract attention, police Chief Rodney Monroe said.</p> <p>Listening to the tape, Chestnut said he doesn't blame the caller, but police missed critical opportunities to de-escalate the situation.</p> <p>""If someone is going to rob your house, they're not going to knock on your door at 2 in the morning. They're not going to ask you to turn down the alarm. I don't expect the caller to deploy that analysis but I would expect the trained 911 dispatcher to at least make the nexus and articulate it for the officer,"" Chestnut said.</p> <p>And when police arrived at the scene, Ferrell was not in the ""immediate vicinity of the home.""</p> <p>""He's down the street. If you just pause and consider ask what's going on, they would realize that it's not consistent with the call. Here you have a guy who's in a green T-shirt and jeans, no shoes - he just survived a car wreck and climbed out the back window and was walking around for help. That's not consistent with a robber...When law enforcement pulls up, he doesn't turn away from you, he runs to you for help. That's not consistent with a robber, either. This was a helpless unarmed frightened young man,"" he said.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.943313"", ""count"": ""12"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Jonathan A.

www.northjersey.com/news/223685101_Career_Coach__That__first_impression__is_really_your_second.html,Hackensack,NJ,Career Coach: That 'first impression' is really your second,20130913T175400,"<p>I was gratified by the high response volume but, as you shall see, it takes more than passively nodding your agreement with this.</p> <p>Coincidentally, a reader wrote the following to me: ""In an upcoming column could you please help job seekers understand that a candidate's first impression starts way before an interview? [For instance,] people looking for a job will send a rsum and cover letter in a handwritten envelope with the person's name misspelled. Yet, they explain how proficient they are with MS Office but the handwritten envelope indicates they don't know how to print a standard envelope using MS Word.""</p> <p>The reader went on. ""The job description indicates the right candidate must be detail-oriented, but when the envelope has misspellings, it is the first indication that they are not."" Also, she continued, ""Candidates will reply to emails using very text-like language: no capitalization, no punctuation, and slang. Serious candidates need to eliminate the word 'got' from their letters. Use a thesaurus to find a substitute.""</p> <p>And her conclusion was, ""If candidates are asking why they're not get- ting interviews, perhaps it's time to step back and take a good look at the first impression they're sending long before any potential interview is possible."" The email was signed with her name, followed by her title: Performance Consultant.</p> <p>Well now, I couldn't agree more - and I'm sure the same will hold true with anyone reading these words, but I must tell you two interesting things about this: one now and one at the end of this column.</p> <p>First, her email came to me before that column appeared: a happy coincidence. I'm glad to know that this matters to someone other than me, and it does bring up a point I make both in my rsum workshops and in my private practice.</p> <p>That point is simple: your rsum - like any other written communication device, such as cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and so on - is really your first impression. It is the way the world sees you before it meets you. Thus, your entry into the room is actually your second impression. This, of course, does not minimize the impact you have when you walk in, but it does help us focus on the importance of powerful and clean written communication.</p> <p>Our reader was focusing on detail-oriented issues, spelling and so forth, and there's no way to overemphasize it. Never mind for now the high-level matters of good writing, expressing key ideas, selecting your words wisely and crafting them into well-sculptured phrases, and being clear, concise and compelling; you've heard that from me (and read it here) many times.</p> <p>The fact remains, though, that these seemingly little things are bigger than they appear, kind of like those images in your side-view mirrors. The difference is that, on your mirror, they at least have the consideration to tell you. In this case, you're on your own to figure it out.</p> <p>It is widely agreed that the No. 1 pet peeve of recruiters and hiring managers is still the issue of misspellings and typographical errors on your letter and rsum. We can include, thanks to this reader, things like lack of capital letters, unnecessary text-like abbreviations, no punctuation, and then - further - more than one font, improper spacing (which might suggest hasty cut-and-paste jobs), and a host of other annoying little (but blatant) errors.</p> <p>Yes, indeed, this is your first impression. And to make it a more weighty issue than it appears on the surface, remember that a lot of your written communications are out there in cyberspace - and will be there forever and for an awful lot of people to see for an awfully long time. If your letter and rsum were sent only in hard copy in a sealed envelope to one person only, then visibility of your mistakes would be limited, maybe even undetected by a less-than-critical reader. The problem is, though, that's not usually the case. When you're out there, you're out there - in a fish bowl.</p> <p>So I think this point is (a) self-evident and (b) big enough to pay closer attention to than we normally and casually do. My reason for making this rather obvious statement brings us to - and was prompted by - the second interesting thing about this story (which I promised above to tell you here).</p> <p>In the email from our performance consultant, who was considerate enough to take the time to write and whose point is well taken - especially about the misspellings - there were two misspellings and one typographical error!</p> <p>I thanked her for her valuable input and politely pointed out her transgressions, for which she sent me an appreciative email with a comment that haste always carries risk.</p> <p>Exactly the point.</p> <p>Career Coach Eli Amdur conducts workshops and one-on-one coaching in Job Search, Career Planning, Rsums and Interviewing.

www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/still_at_odds_with_time_warner.html,Staten_Island,NY,"Still at odds with Time Warner Cable, CBS signs agreement with Verizon FiOS",20130822T122400,"<p>STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The good news is that CBS has reached an agreement with a cable company.</p> <p>The bad news for Time Warner Cable customers, who have been without CBS programming since Aug, 2, is that the agreement was reached with competitor, Verizon Fios.</p> <p>Amid the Time Warner Cable/CBS dispute over carriage fees that has played out over the last month, was an announcement by CBS that it has reached a new three-year contract for continued retransmission of CBS owned stations with Verizon Fios. The agreement also includes a provision for wider distribution of CBS Sports Network on Verizon's FiOS TV in multiple markets across the country -- including Staten Island.</p> <p>""This important deal was reached swiftly and amicably in just a few days after our</p> <p>conversations began,"" said Leslie Moonves, CBS's president and CEO, in a memo to CBS employees Thursday morning.</p> <p>""In it, we achieve fair value for our over-the-air rights, while preserving our streaming rights as well. CBS content will be available to 100 percent of all Verizon FiOS customers, and we will grow as they do.""</p> <p>In the memo, Moonves took a shot at Time Warner Cable. ""You should know that Time Warner Cable has been offered almost exactly the same deal for CBS carriage to which Verizon has agreed.""</p> <p>The ongoing dispute stems from CBS wanting to raise the carriage fees, and Time Warner Cable maintaining that the price they're asking is too high.</p> <p>""We remain hard at work trying to reach an agreement that will quickly return CBS shows to our customers, and we regret CBS has put our customers in this position by withholding its networks and CBS Primetime on Demand, as well as blocking customers from cbs.com programming that is free to other Internet users,"" said Richard Ruggiero, a Time Warner Cable spokesman.</p> <p>""We are trying to strike a balance between our desire to restore programming as quickly as possible and our responsibility to all of our customers to hold down the rising cost of TV.""</p> <p>However, in what appears to be a temporary truce, Time Warner Cable and CBS agreed to air Thursday's city comptroller debate on Channel 2.</p> <p>Other debates -- including one between Republican mayoral candidates on Aug. 28, a potential runoff debate between the top Democratic mayoral candidates on Sept. 23 and a debate between the mayoral candidates in the general election on Oct. 22 -- will also air on CBS if the two sides don't reach an agreement before then.</p>","[{""relevance"":

mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20131010p2a00m0na005000c.html,New_York,NY,"Fearing retribution, many in Pakistan are silent on girl favored to win Nobel Peace Prize - ",20141021T000000,"<p>One year after the shooting of Pakistani girl Malala Yousafzai by militants on her way home from school the media is abuzz as she is favored to win the Nobel Peace Prize, but many back in Pakistan are reluctant to mention her name to reporters.</p> <p>Malala, now 16, touted the importance of education for women and children since before the shooting, and has continued to do so even after her treatment and recovery in England.</p> <p>On Oct. 7, the school Malala attended in her hometown of Mingora, located in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley and under watch by the Pakistani military, was busy with visiting reporters. Managed by Malala's father Ziauddin, the school continues to hold class after the shooting, but it told the Mainichi not to ask anyone at the school about Malala, and forbade any photography of the students. School faculty did not talk about what has happened since the shooting, nor did they ever mention the words ""Nobel Peace Prize.""</p> <p>However, on a road around three kilometers away, a 15-year-old girl attending a different school said quietly, before leaving, that she hoped Malala would win the prize.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Oct. 7, Shahidullah Shahid, spokesman for the Pakistani branch of the Taliban movement, warned that the group would kill Malala if it gets the chance. Since the shooting, Malala, her parents and two brothers have lived in England. Still, both Pakistani authorities and regular citizens fear that if Malala wins the Nobel Peace Prize it could antagonize the Taliban.</p> <p>Malala's 44-year-old relative Ahmed Shah Yousufzai, who manages another school in Mingora, remains in Pakistan. He says that thanks to Malala's bravery there has been a 15 percent increase in children attending school in Swat Valley since the shooting.</p> <p>Ahmed, who accompanied Malala on her trip to speak at the United Nations headquarters in July, says that if Malala wins the peace prize, even more children will be inspired to go to school.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ahead of the announcement of the prize winner on Oct. 11, major media outlets have been giving heavy coverage on Malala. On Oct. 6, British paper The Sunday Times reported Malala's feelings after the shooting, while the British broadcaster BBC ran a 30-minute documentary on the girl on Oct. 7. In the United States, broadcaster ABC ran an interview with Malala on Oct. 7, while CNN plans a special program on Malala for Oct. 13 entitled ""The Bravest Girl in the World.""</p> <p>On Oct. 8, Malala's first autobiography, ""I am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban,"" went on sale worldwide.

www.oneidadispatch.com/articles/2013/10/01/opinion/doc5249c59db190d250443828.txt?viewmode=fullstory,Oneida,NY,Maryland bravely passes gun control,,"<p>Peter Funt</p> <p>DISTRICT HEIGHTS, Md.>> There's a certain type of bravery taking place in the nation's 19th most populous state, whose border is about two miles from the Washington Navy Yard, scene of a horrifying mass gun attack.</p> <p>A tough new gun law takes effect in Maryland Oct. 1. It's not lip-service tough. Not politically-measured tough. This law is tough in a way that confirms the bravery of the state legislators who voted for it and Gov. Martin O'Malley who signed it.</p> <p>The law should be a blueprint for the nation. Here's what it says:</p> <p>If you want to buy a handgun, you must be fingerprinted, take a safety test and get a $50 license. Even then, you may only purchase one such gun every 30 days.</p> <p>If you want to buy an AK-47, AR-15 or any of 45 other semi-automatics and copycats, forget it. You can't.</p> <p>You also can't buy a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, and you can't own the type of ""cop-killer"" bullets that have led to the deaths of at least 35 officers in the last decade.</p> <p>There's a lot more: a uniform procedure by which dealers and state police register firearms; a ban on those with criminal records or mental health problems from owning guns and all types of ammunition, and a new requirement for state police to shut down rogue dealers whose guns show up in a disproportionate number of crimes.</p> <p>It's tough. You know that because the NRA and a lot of its supporters here hate it.</p> <p>And you know it has teeth because for the last month or so there's been a run on handguns and automatic weapons at shops like Realco Guns here in District Heights. Statewide, gun sales in September have been about seven times the levels of a year ago.</p> <p>That's an unfortunate byproduct of the new law.</p> <p>Even more unfortunate is that until other states pass similar laws, and until the federal government deals more aggressively with Internet guns sales, Maryland's efforts will only be partially effective.</p> <p>""Our tears are not enough,"" President Obama declared after 12 people were shot by a gunman at the DC Navy Yard. But the president's own gun legislation has been blocked in Congress and has no chance in this session.</p> <p>Also troubling is that firearms manufacturers remain exempted from the type of product-liability laws that govern so many other products. Indeed, since 2005 federal law has moved in the opposite direction by offering specific protection to gun makers in lawsuits and other claims.</p> <p>Violent crime here in Maryland has already reached an historic low according to state figures. But Gov. O'Malley notes, ""Just one life lost to senseless violence is one too many."" He correctly labeled the new law ""a common sense approach"" to dealing with the nation's gun nightmare that has extended from Aurora, to Newtown, to the Washington Navy Yard -- with many horrifying stops between.</p> <p>Colorado's lawmakers have also addressed the gun plague bravely, with new laws that expand the state's background-check system to include private sales; keep guns out of the hands of criminals; limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds, and prohibit domestic abusers from buying or keeping guns.</p> <p>Which state's lawmakers will be the next to show enough gumption to implement similar laws?</p> <p>Here in Maryland, the man behind the counter at Realco Guns was struggling to serve a crowd of customers on a weekday morning, just a few days before the new law was to take effect.</p> <p>""We don't give out information, we don't do interviews, and we don't answer questions,"" he said.</p> <p>Then, taking a quick step back, he added, ""Unless you want to buy a gun.""</p> <p>Peter Funt's latest book, ""Cautiously Optimistic,"" is available at Amazon.com and CandidCamera.com.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.736786"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.maryland.gov"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Maryland"", ""census"": ""http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/geo/us/md"", ""geonames"": ""http://sws.geonames.org/4361885/"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.04rrd"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViu2pwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""PoliticalDistrict"", ""AdministrativeDivision"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction"", ""USState"", ""AirportOperator""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryland"", ""name"": ""Maryland""}, ""text"": ""Maryland""}, {""relevance"": ""0.644344"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Company"", ""text"": ""Realco Guns""}, {""relevance"": ""0.596754"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.gov.state.md.us/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Martin_O'Malley"", ""name"": ""Martin O'Malley"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03kf8m"", ""subType"": [""Politician"", ""Governor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_O'Malley""}, ""text"": ""Gov.

(Courtesy of the Shqair family)</p> <p>The Palestinian immigrant worked at Sabatino's Pizza and Deli from 9 a.m. until 3 a.m. almost every day.</p> <p>Before work, he took his five children to school in the morning. Relatives and co-workers begged Shqair, who co-owned the store with his wife Julia, to take a day off.</p> <p>But there he was anyway early Tuesday morning, alone behind his counter, when an unidentified suspect entered the store around 1 a.m. and demanded money.</p> <p>Shqair tried to negotiate with the man, who instead shot Shqair and ran out of the store, at 121 Ballantyne Road. Shqair, 38, was taken to Upstate University Hospital where he died in emergency surgery, according to Syracuse police Sgt. Tom Connellan. Police were notified at 12:30 p.m. that he had died.</p> <p>The suspect -- who wore a mask to obscure his face -- appeared nervous during the attack, Connellan said.</p> <p>The whole incident lasted less than two minutes. The suspect never took any money.</p> <p>""It's surreal,"" said Sylvanna Mitrevska, a sister-in-law.

Police received 16 calls related to the store in 2010, 29 in 2011, 45 in 2012 and 40 in 2013.</p> <p>Two men were shot leaving the store in 2001, according to The Post-Standard's archives. A Sabatino's delivery man was robbed in 2005. A man was stabbed outside the store in 2008 and then another man was stabbed there in 2011.</p> <p>Shqair was once robbed by three men with guns, John Shqair said. But business, not violence, was always his overriding concern, John Shqair said.</p> <p>Shqair came over from the Palestinian city of Ramallah about four years ago to join his wife and help her run the store. Shqair didn't know more than a few words of English or how to make a pizza.</p> <p>Surveillance photo of the suspect responsible for shooting and killing a clerk at Sabatino's Pizza. The suspect appears to be a male of unknown race, wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with what appears to be a Notre Dame logo on the chest in gold letters, he has a purple bandanna over his face, blue and gray gloves and blue jeans.  Syracuse police</p> <p>""He's smart; he learned quickly ... Like most other people, (Shqair thought) America was a rich land full of money and opportunity,"" Mitrevska said. ""I wonder what his family in Palestine thinks now.""</p> <p>Shqair and his wife were saving to move out of their north side home to a better place, Mitrevska said. They needed money to help pay for their planned expansion of the pizza shop. He also wanted to be sure they could provide for his children, who range in age from 11 to 17.</p> <p>""He taught his kids the same way and the whole family,"" Mitrevska said.  ""Work hard.""</p> <p>Robert Aouad, a neighbor and employee of the pizzeria for several years, agreed.</p> <p>Shqair was killed during the one shift a week Aouad has off -- a luxury Aouad said Shqair never took himself.</p> <p>""I used to say to him, 'What can I do to give you a day off?,'"" Aouad said. ""He never took one.""</p> <p>Shqair's son Khalil agreed, calling his dad an ""unbelievably"" hard worker. Shqair was also a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day.</p> <p>""Day and night, for two or three days at a time,"" said Pete Rausa, a customer, sitting outside Sabatino's on Tuesday. ""He was always here.""</p> <p>Khalil and the Shqairs gathered Tuesday afternoon at 125 Herbert Ave., one house over from Shqair's house at 123 Herbert Ave. They bought a Dominos' pizza to share with Shqair's friends and co-workers. His sons helped an elderly woman carry her silverware into the house.</p> <p>Shqair's only daughter and youngest child, 11, came out to the porch, where Mitrevska watched as her husband mowed the lawn. The girl asked something about ""daddy"" before running back inside.</p> <p>""[Shqair] treated her like an angel, a queen. Anything she wanted, she got,"" Mitrevska said. ""Since he was at work, he wasn't able to be with his kids, so he could never tell them 'no.' He always felt like it was the least he could do.""</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.913608"", ""count"": ""30"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Shqair Shqair""}, {""relevance"": ""0.298387"", ""count"": ""13"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Sylvanna Mitrevska""}, {""relevance"": ""0.240448"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Shqair""}, {""relevance"": ""0.237138"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.syracuse.ny.us/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Syracuse,_New_York"", ""census"": ""http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/geo/us/ny/counties/onondaga_county/syracuse"", ""name"": ""Syracuse, New York"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.071cn"", ""subType"": [""PlaceWithNeighborhoods""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse,_New_York"", ""geo"": ""43.04694444444444 -76.14444444444445"", ""geonames"": ""http://sws.geonames.org/5140405/""}, ""text"": ""Syracuse""}, {""relevance"": ""0.225931"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Sabatino""}, {""relevance"": ""0.224744"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Company"", ""text"": ""Sabatino""}, {""relevance"": ""0.185237"", ""count"": ""5"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Robert Aouad""}, {""relevance"": ""0.16739"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Sgt.

www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/v-not_leader_driver_in_fatal_shooting_pleads_guilty.html,Syracuse,NY,"Syracuse street gang member, driver in fatal shooting, pleads guilty",20130917T180400,"<p>SYRACUSE, NY -- A Syracuse street gang member who was the driver in a drive-by fatal shooting of a star athlete three years ago pleaded guilty today in federal court to racketeering charges.</p> <p>Habakkuk Nickens, 27, admitted his role in  the V-NOT gang, which used violence to control its drug-trafficking business on the city's south side.</p> <p>Nickens was one of the two leaders of V-NOT, prosecutors said in court papers.</p> <p>In his written plea agreement, Nickens admitted his role in the shooting death of Kihary Blue. Nickens drove a van into position near the interchange of I-81 and I-690 in downtown Syracuse on Nov. 26, 2010, pulling alongside a car known to be used by rival Bricktown gang members, prosecutors said.</p> <p>Nickens' front-passenger, Kihari Smith, then fired multiple shots from a .40-caliber handgun into the car, according to court papers.</p> <p>The first shot struck and killed Blue, who was in the middle of the back seat, prosecutors said. The shot struck Blue in the back of the head, court papers said.</p> <p>Blue was not a member of a street gang, but was with four Bricktown gang members in the car, police said.</p> <p>Smith kept firing, striking Bricktown member Jarrell Williams in the leg, court papers said.</p> <p>At least three eyewitnesses identified Smith as the shooter, court papers said.</p> <p>Blue, 19, was a star football and basketball player at Henninger High School before he graduated in 2009.</p> <p>Two days after that shooting, Bricktown member Saquan Evans targeted the wrong gang for retaliation. He fired  into the parked van of 110 Gang member Rashaad Walker Sr., killing his toddler son, Rashaad Walker Jr., who was in a car seat.</p> <p>Evans was convicted of murder last year for killing the 20-month-old boy.</p> <p>After Blue's death, Nickens tried to distance himself from the V-NOT gang, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Katko  wrote in court papers. Nickens started a community outreach program that he called ""Help Break Down the Silence"" and claimed it was intended to help troubled inner-city youths, Katko wrote.</p> <p>But multiple V-NOT gang members are prepared to testify that Nickens got involved in the program solely to prepare for his defense against racketeering charges that he knew would be coming as a result of Blue's death, Katko wrote.</p> <p>Before today's guilty plea, Katko asked U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue not to allow Nickens to introduce his community outreach involvement at his trial.</p> <p>In court today, Nickens maintained that he started the group because he ""made a vow to rebuild the youth."" He apologized for his conduct to his parents, who were in the courtroom, and to Katko, the judge, and defense lawyer William Sullivan.</p> <p>Nickens faces up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine when he's sentenced Jan. 14.</p> <p>Kihari Smith and Nathan King are the only defendants out of 11 who have not pleaded guilty. The gang members were arrested in May 2012 by the Syracuse Gang Violence Task Force.</p> <p>Smith and King are scheduled to go to trial Oct. 1.</p> <p>A federal indictment accused the V-NOT members of murder, robbery, drug-trafficking and witness tampering. V-NOT was the sixth gang in nine years that the task force targeted for federal prosecution, arresting a total of 90 suspected gang members.</p> <p>V-NOT, which stands for Valley (N-words) On Top, controlled a territory on the South Side, with West Newell Street as the northern border, police said.</p> <p>Contact John O'Brien at jobrien@syracuse.com or 315-470-2187.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.769692"", ""count"": ""17"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Habakkuk Nickens""}, {""relevance"": ""0.585887"", ""count"": ""7"", ""type"": ""GeographicFeature"", ""text"": ""Kihary Blue""}, {""relevance"": ""0.49854"", ""count"": ""5"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""John Katko""}, {""relevance"": ""0.477763"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Kihari Smith""}, {""relevance"": ""0.431232"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.syracuse.ny.us/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Syracuse,_New_York"", ""census"": ""http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/geo/us/ny/counties/onondaga_county/syracuse"", ""name"": ""Syracuse, New York"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.071cn"", ""subType"": [""PlaceWithNeighborhoods""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syracuse,_New_York"", ""geo"": ""43.04694444444444 -76.14444444444445"", ""geonames"": ""http://sws.geonames.org/5140405/""}, ""text"": ""SYRACUSE""}, {""relevance"": ""0.374655"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Bricktown""}, {""relevance"": ""0.314938"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Crime"", ""text"": ""racketeering""}, {""relevance"": ""0.313558"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Saquan Evans""}, {""relevance"": ""0.279144"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""Crime"", ""text"": ""murder""}, {""relevance"": ""0.274951"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.ny.gov"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/New_York"", ""census"": ""http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/geo/us/ny"", ""name"": ""New York"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01mf5p"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViNs5wpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""PoliticalDistrict"", ""AdministrativeDivision"", ""Country"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction"", ""USState"", ""WineRegion""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York"", ""geo"": ""43.0 -75.0""}, ""text"": ""NY""}, {""relevance"": ""0.261568"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""disambiguated"": {""subType"": [""Location"", ""School""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henninger_High_School"", ""name"": ""Henninger High School"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03cwhvm""}, ""text"": ""Henninger High School""}, {""relevance"": ""0.253754"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Norman_A._Mordue"", ""subType"": [""Judge"", ""MilitaryPerson""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norman_A._Mordue"", ""name"": ""Norman A.

Photo Eleanor Roosevelt Leadership Center At Val-Kill, Bill Urbin    Surely, in the light of history, it is more intelligent to hope rather than to fear, to try rather than not to try. For one thing we know beyond all doubt: Nothing has ever been achieved by the person who says, `It cant be done.</p> <p>Eleanor Roosevelt</p> <p>Gloria Steinem is perhaps the best known living proponent of American feminism; a fierce, smart, and energetic advocate for gender equality who first emerged on the political scene in the 1960s and has been active ever since.</p> <p>On Sunday at the Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kill Medal Award & Brunch Ceremony, Steinemalong with Joan Davidson, the Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union, Glen Johnson, Senator Patrick Leahy, and Marcelle Pomerleau Leahywas honored for her lasting humanitarian contributions. She agreed to an interview while we were there; the PCN&R received a special invitation to cover the event.</p> <p>At right is the event organizer, Roosevelt Center President Kathleen Durham, and left, Kate Roosevelt Whitney, Eleanor Roosevelts granddaughter.  Photo by Annie Chesnut The Eleanor Roosevelt Leadership Center described Gloria Steinem as, Writer, lecturer, editor, and feminist activist. Co-founder Ms. Magazine. Founding president of Ms. Foundation for Women, a national multi-racial, multi-issue fund that supports grassroots projects to empower women and girls. Founder of its Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the first national day devoted to girls. Extraordinary social justice activist; Change agent; Galvanizer. But especially significant to us is the fact that Steinem is also an accomplished journalist and author.</p> <p>Now 79, shes instantly recognizable with her trademark hair and glasses. In person, shes warm and engaged, a thoughtful conversationalist and a careful listener. Steinem was genuinely pleased to be selected as a Roosevelt medal winner, but made it clear that her own legacy is in no way completetheres plenty more work to be done.</p> <p>This native of Toledo, Ohio was raised by a mother who revered Eleanor Roosevelt, and Steinem recalls vividly how that informed her own perception of womens capabilities.</p> <p>Steinem is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Smith College, in Northampton, Mass. Julia Child, Sylvia Plath, Molly Ivins, Betty Friedan, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush were all Smithies, as is my own daughter. At the time Steinem attended, Smith was one of the Seven Sisters schoolsBryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesleya group of womens colleges that technically no longer exists since Sarah Lawrence and Vassar are now co-ed and Radcliffe was absorbed by Harvard.</p> <p>We asked Steinem, How important is it to you that women have safe spaces for education and how much did your Smith experience inform your later activities?</p> <p>She responded, I believe that we should support the historically female campuses and the historically black campuses because if were in that group or groups thats not central to society we need to have that experience of centrality at least once in our lives. She added that people have different kinds of lives and some may not need that centrality, but that its very important to have it as a choice.</p> <p>As for the future of women in American politics? What we make it. Only what we make it. Its never been about biology; its always been about consciousness. There will always be some men who are better feminists than some women, but the best combination is when it comes together, when you know what its like to walk around as a female for 30 or 40 years in this culture.</p> <p>As for the role of feminism in todays world, Steinem said, Weve barely begun. Asked what a modern-day feminist should be working on, she added, There are no shoulds. Its important, she said, that we support each other in our diversity, not that we dictate one goal. Sometimes, she noted, priorities are imposed from the outside, as can happen at election time, but, We are strongest when each of us is doing what we love, what we care about so much that we would do it even if we didnt get paid to do it. Our jobs are as much to listen as to talk.</p> <p>Of Eleanor Roosevelt, Steinem said, She was a big part of my childhood. She was the single thing that connected my mother to the government. And, Steinem added, Because she stayed true to herself, her message about human rights is as fresh and inspiring now as it was when she was alive</p> <p>In a casualty of the ongoing federal government shutdown, the event was moved to from the Val-Kill estate in Hyde Park to the lavishly appointed Astor Courts, in Rhinebeck.</p> <p>Kathleen Durham, who is the president of the Eleanor Roosevelt Leadership Center, welcomed all of the honorees and guests for a meet-and-greet reception followed by a festive luncheon at which the medals were conferred.</p> <p>Steinem has traveled extensively and written seriously about the cultures in which women are key participants.</p> <p>What we are all demonstrating in different ways is that people are people and that gender is an artificial invention. What we need to understand more is that  the masculine role got invented in order to control reproduction [with the feminine role being subordinate to that] What inspires me are the original cultures, some on this continent, who didnt have gender [roles]Right where were sitting there was a nation of the Iroquois Confederacy in which women werepart of every decision making structure.</p> <p>Our final question for Steinem was. What are you most proud of?</p> <p>Her smiling reply: I havent done it yet.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.86602"", ""count"": ""14"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""disambiguated"": {""yago"":

www.qgazette.com/news/2013-10-02/Features/Detectives_Seize_Drugs_Guns_In_Numbers_Case.html,Astoria,NY,"Detectives Seize Drugs, Guns In Numbers Case | www.qgazette.com | Queens Gazette",20131002T000000,"<p>In executing search warrants in the wake of an indictment charging six individuals with unlawfully running an illegal gambling operation in Queens County and elsewhere, police recovered six guns including two MP-15 assault rifles, hundreds of narcotic pills, gambling records and more than $120,000 in cash. Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown (far r.) is joined by (l. to r.); NYPD Inspector Michael E. Bryan, commanding officer, Queens Narcotics Division; and Detective Andrew Lenski. Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown, joined by New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, announced on September 24 that in executing search warrants  in the wake of an indictment charging six individuals with unlawfully running an illegal gambling operation in Queens County and elsewhere  detectives recovered six guns, including twoMP-15 assault rifles, hundreds of narcotic pills, gambling records and more than $120,000 in cash.</p> <p>Brown said, With the execution of these search warrants we have taken six more deadly weapons off the streets of Queens County. I applaud the police and prosecutors working together to safeguard our streets. An investigation that started with illegal gambling has nowled to the recovery of a deadly and dangerous combination of guns and drugs.</p> <p>Kelly said, The nexus between illegal drugs and violence is never far. It is thanks to New York City detectives and their partners in the Queens district attorneys office that five loaded guns, including assault weapons are out of circulation, along with illegally obtained prescription drugs.</p> <p>The district attorney identified the defendants charged in the gambling case as Saul Montalvo, 44, of 137-30 Lafayette St. in Ozone Park; his sister, Veronica Montalvo, 40, of 90-02 97th Ave. in Ozone Park; his son, Daniel Montalvo, 26, of 99-11 57th Ave. in Corona; Juan Arias, 41, of 85 Strong St. in The Bronx; Benny Maldonado, 60, of 60-81 Myrtle Ave. in Ridgewood; and Rosa Rincon, 56, of 106-17 95th Ave. in Woodhaven.</p> <p>The defendants were arraigned in Queens Supreme Court in Kew Gardens on an indictment variously charging them with the crimes of enterprise corruption, first-degree promoting gambling and first degree possession of gambling records. The defendants, who each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, were ordered held on bail amounts ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 and to return to court on October 28. In the cases of Saul Montalvo and Arias, both reserved their bail applications for a later date and were remanded until that time.</p> <p>In addition to the criminal charges outlined in the indictment, Saul Montalvo and his wife, Beatriz Velez, 33, have been variously charged in criminal complaints with third-, fifth- and seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, second-, third- and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of a firearm, fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property, first-degree promoting gambling and first-degree possession of gambling records. Montalvos son, Daniel, was also arrested on a criminal complaint charging him with second-, third- and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon. The parents and son each face up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the weapons charges. Daniel Montalvo was ordered to return to court on October 2, and Saul Montalvo and Velez next court appearance was scheduled for October 10.</p> <p>Brown said that following the arrests last week on gambling charges, police executed court-authorized search warrants at 12 locations, including Saul Montalvos Lafayette Street residence, where, according to the criminal charges, the police recovered:</p> <p>120 Percocet pills, 75 Oxycontin pills, 35 Hydrocodone pills and betting slips from inside a kitchen cabinet;</p> <p>A 9mm Taurus pistol loaded with a high-capacity magazine which contained 16 live rounds, a .45 caliber Taurus pistol loaded with eight rounds of live ammunition (which had been reported stolen a year ago in Pennsylvania), a .45 caliber Ruger pistol also loaded with eight rounds of live ammunition; and more than $90,000 in cash from a safe inside a closet in the master bedroom; and</p> <p>A loaded 12 gauge Mossberg shotgun, a Smith & Wesson MP-15 assault rifle which was loaded with a high-capacity magazine holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, as well as three other magazines all loaded with more than 10 rounds of ammunition from the laundry area.</p> <p>The Mossberg shotgun and the MP-15 assault rifle are alleged to belong to Daniel Montalvo, who at the time of his arrest allegedly stated that he had another MP-15 rifle at his Corona residence. In searching the premises, it is alleged that police recovered a Smith & Wesson MP-15 assault rifle in a rifle case in the bedroom closet, as well as four high-capacity magazines, two of which were loaded with 20 rounds of live ammunition.</p> <p>Brown said that the NYPDs Queens Narcotics Division and his Narcotics Investigation Bureau commenced an investigation in February 2013 of an illegal gambling operation allegedly being run by the defendants Saul Montalvo and his partner Juan Arias, which, according to the criminal charges, operated a central wire room in Brooklyn, run by defendant Veronica Montalvo and others. It is alleged that the wire room maintained a number of fax machines that received betting slips from more than 30 betting parlors scattered throughout Queens, Brooklyn and Nassau County. A second wire room was operated by the defendant Rosa Rincon from a house in Woodhaven. The defendants Daniel Montalvo and Maldonado allegedly were primarily tasked with collecting and distributing money to the betting parlors.</p> <p>In addition to the search warrants executed at the two Montalvo residences, search warrants were also executed at the two wire rooms and various betting parlors in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island.

Oct. 7, relies on a flawed New York Times article that claimed the number of child gun accident deaths was roughly double what official records show.</p> <p>Without detailing their methods, the Times writers say they determined which accidental shootings were misclassified by experts as homicides or suicides. Unfortunately, the authors did not look for the opposite type of error: homicides or suicides misclassified as accidents. So, we should believe that New York Times reporters are better equipped to make medical examining determinations than are medical examiners, but the result of such a one-sided search is inevitably erroneous.</p> <p>It took the Times 75 paragraphs in its 110-paragraph, 6,000-word story to acknowledge that U.S. Department of Justice statistics show a dramatic 30-year downward trend in accidental deaths involving firearms at the same time that the number of firearms held by American citizens has increased greatly. But that's not the impression the Times wanted to leave with its readers.</p> <p>The firearms industry continues to work with 15,000 law enforcement agencies to put gun safety kits, including gun locks, into households through Project ChildSafe. We have distributed more than 36 million locks to date.</p> <p>The focus should be on keeping firearms away from those who should not have them, including children.</p> <p>Newtown, Conn.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.965587"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""PrintMedia"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.nytimes.com"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/The_New_York_Times"", ""name"": ""The New York Times"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.07k2d"", ""subType"": [""Organization"", ""Company"", ""AwardPresentingOrganization"", ""AwardWinner"", ""CompanyShareholder"", ""Newspaper""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_New_York_Times""}, ""text"": ""New York Times""}, {""relevance"": ""0.768946"", ""count"": ""2"", ""type"": ""PrintMedia"", ""text"": ""Times""}, {""relevance"": ""0.4635"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""City"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.newtown-ct.gov/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Newtown,_Connecticut"", ""name"": ""Newtown, Connecticut"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0bgrr0"", ""subType"": [], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newtown,_Connecticut""}, ""text"": ""Newtown""}, {""relevance"": ""0.453734"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""FieldTerminology"", ""text"": ""law enforcement agencies""}, {""relevance"": ""0.442049"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Organization"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.usdoj.gov"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_Justice"", ""name"": ""United States Department of Justice"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0dtj5"", ""subType"": [""GovernmentAgency"", ""GovernmentalBody"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Department_of_Justice""}, ""text"": ""Department of Justice""}, {""relevance"": ""0.425797"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""text"": ""Conn""}, {""relevance"": ""0.409821"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""JobTitle"", ""text"": ""official""}, {""relevance"": ""0.387464"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Country"", ""disambiguated"": {""website"": ""http://www.usa.gov/"", ""yago"": ""http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/United_States"", ""name"": ""United States"", ""freebase"": ""http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.09c7w0"", ""opencyc"": ""http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvVikKpwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA"", ""subType"": [""Location"", ""Region"", ""AdministrativeDivision"", ""GovernmentalJurisdiction"", ""FilmEditor""], ""dbpedia"": ""http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"", ""ciaFactbook"": ""http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/factbook/resource/United_States""}, ""text"": ""U.S.""}, {""relevance"": ""0.387464"", ""count"": ""1"", ""type"": ""Quantity"", ""text"": ""30-year""}]","[{""relevance"": ""0.972649"", ""text"": ""New York Times""}, {""relevance"": ""0.842537"", ""text"": ""gun accident deaths""}, {""relevance"": ""0.771745"", ""text"": ""flawed New York""}, {""relevance"": ""0.746838"", ""text"": ""30-year downward trend""}, {""relevance"": ""0.71192"", ""text"": ""medical examining determinations""}, {""relevance"": ""0.702181"", ""text"": ""gun safety kits""}, {""relevance"": ""0.699972"", ""text"": ""York Times reporters""}, {""relevance"": ""0.661766"", ""text"": ""law enforcement agencies""}, {""relevance"": ""0.563882"", ""text"": ""accidental shootings""}, {""relevance"": ""0.545354"", ""text"": ""firearms industry""}, {""relevance"": ""0.542186"", ""text"": ""accidental deaths""}, {""relevance"": ""0.516303"", ""text"": ""gun locks""}, {""relevance"": ""0.511296"", ""text"": ""6,000-word story""}, {""relevance"": ""0.509864"", ""text"": ""Times article""}, {""relevance"": ""0.50302"", ""text"": ""one-sided search""}, {""relevance"": ""0.500878"", ""text"": ""official records""}, {""relevance"": ""0.49386"", ""text"": ""opposite type""}, {""relevance"": ""0.489496"", ""text"": ""Project ChildSafe""}, {""relevance"": ""0.488428"", ""text"": ""Times writers""}, {""relevance"": ""0.47855"", ""text"": ""medical examiners""}, {""relevance"": ""0.463266"", ""text"": ""U.S. Department""}, {""relevance"": ""0.462896"", ""text"": ""Justice statistics""}, {""relevance"": ""0.459413"", ""text"": ""American citizens""}, {""relevance"": ""0.379436"", ""text"": ""homicides""}, {""relevance"": ""0.363033"", ""text"": ""suicides""}, {""relevance"": ""0.290184"", ""text"": ""number""}, {""relevance"": ""0.274395"", ""text"": ""caliber""}, {""relevance"": ""0.264687"", ""text"": ""Conn""}, {""relevance"": ""0.262567"", ""text"": ""paragraphs""}, {""relevance"": ""0.258622"", ""text"": ""households""}]"

That has been turned down,"" Huron County Prosecutor Russell Leffler said at Monday's pre-trial hearing. ""We're willing to leave it open until Friday.""</p> <p>Sax and defense attorney Sarah Nation confirmed they had turned down the prosecutor's offer earlier.</p> <p>""I've only been offered one offer over the last seven months,"" Sax told Judge Jim Conway.</p> <p>Leffler said the state offered no deal for the male victim.</p> <p>""There were some charges pending in juvenile court at the time of victimization,"" he said.</p> <p>Sax's sister, Treva M. Campbell, 30, of 38 Newton St., is a co-defendant in the case. She is the girlfriend of a third accomplice, Norwalk resident Larry Thornsberry, 36.</p> <p>Campbell, in late April, pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence. As part of a plea deal, the state dismissed one count of burglary. Prosecutors have said Campbell is expected to testify against her brother. She will be sentenced Oct. 9.</p> <p>Thornsberry pleaded guilty in April to burglary and attempted tampering with evidence. His sentencing hearing was scheduled for today; however that was pushed back until Oct. 30.</p> <p>Campbell drove Sax and Thornsberry to the victim's home, where Thornsberry grabbed the victim from behind in a choke-hold and Sax repeatedly hit him with a black handgun, prosecutors and the victim have said. After the assault, Campbell drove her accomplices away from the scene and stopped the vehicle so Sax could throw out the weapon.</p> <p>On March 8, a Huron County Sheriff's Office search team found an airsoft pistol in water under a Jennings Road bridge adjacent to the Fitchville Conservation Club.</p> <p>The victim went to Fisher-Titus Medical Center to have staples put in his head.</p> <p>Campbell's defense attorney, Tom Freeman, has denied his client entered the house, but prosecutors have said witnesses placed her at the scene and Campbell, who had been waiting in the car, decided to go inside the victim's house to see what was taking so long.</p> <p>Investigators determined the situation began to develop when Sax's girlfriend -- a 23-year-old New London woman -- went to her ex-boyfriend's home to retrieve her laptop computer. Charges against her were dismissed later.</p> <p>I do remember you were always good.  I lived near you when you were little on State St.  I believe you were probably just trying to be nice and your brother took advantage.  He's always been bad.  He pulled a knife on me when I was 11 because I wouldn't kiss him.  I think he got sent away for that.  I would say that even if you love him, you should stay away from him.  You don't want your kids around someone like that.  It might be hard, but he has a long history, so I doubt he will change.</p> <p>Well my name is Diane Darling.  I have never drove a get away car. I have never been in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"" of driving THEIVES.  I have never dated a criminal.  You never intended to drive the getaway car or stop to allow them to throw the ""gun"" away? When did you know that it was going wrong? Most of the people that ""talk s@$t"" are not in trouble with the law.  That kinda lets them get away with talking s@$t. I'm not scared of you knowing my name either.  I'm not a criminal.</p> <p>Just because you have a degree doesn't mean s*h*t! You CHOSE to put yourself in that situation! You CHOSE to live with drug addicts and allow that behavior around your children....you don't deserve to ever have your children back!! I'm sorry but IMO people who condone this type of behavior and enable it are just as GUILTY as the ones who did it! And the witness said you were in the house, they described what you look like!!! So now you wanna testify against your own brother to save your a**.....you my dear are PATHETIC!!!!</p> <p>If you hang around the barn yard long enough, you'll start smelling like $hit.  While you may value your 2 year degree, and job (which probably won't last long as much as your picture is in the paper), ""decent parts of society"" don't haul around felons and break into houses and pistol whip people.  Maybe this is what YOU do in your spare time, but it's not the norm.  I know you're related to Teardrop and all, but you may wanna cut the ties.  And really, who uses an Airsoft pistol anyway?  That's not gangsta, that's a wanna be white trash trailer park move.    Hanging out with trashy wanna be gangsters isn't ""being in the wrong place at the wrong time"", it's a choice YOU MADE.  You burned your own rear end, now it's time to sit on the blister.  Quit hanging out with trash, and people won't think you're a loser.  But as long as your mug is up there between these two hilljack wannabe trailer park gangters most people are just going to consider you a loser.  Sorry.  Hopefully you can turn that 2 year degree into a 4 year degree while you're behind bars, where criminals belong.  :o)</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.802929"", ""count"": ""7"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Jeremy M.

www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/usatoday/article/2650231,Zanesville,OH,"Gunman, hostage dead in La. bank standoff | Zanesville Times Recorder | zanesvilletimesrecorder.com",20130814T000000,"<p>ST. JOSEPH, La. - A man who held bank employees hostage at a branch in rural Louisiana shot the two remaining hostages before police killed him early Wednesday after a 12-hour standoff.</p> <p>Col. Mike Edmonson, Louisiana State Police superintendent, said the hostages were taken from the scene at the Tensas State Bank branch here in critical condition.</p> <p>The Associated Press reported that one of the shot hostages later died.</p> <p>The suspect was identified as Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, 20, whose family owns a convenience store in this Mississippi River town, Edmondson said.</p> <p>""I wouldn't expect something like that to happen here,'' Mayor Edward Brown said.  ""It's just bizarre.""</p> <p>St. Joseph is a quiet farming town of about 1,200 residents about 100 miles north of the state capital of Baton Rouge.</p> <p>Earlier, the suspect seized the three bank employees before releasing a female hostage, identified as Patricia Davis, unharmed after nine hours. A man and a woman remained captive.</p> <p>Family members of some hostages told  The (Monroe, La.) News Star, published by Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY, that they had heard the gunman had given authorities 10 hours to adhere to his demands, which were not revealed.</p> <p>At about 4 p.m. CT, a car broke through a police perimeter and drove toward the bank, The News Star reported. It said the driver, a family member of the suspect, was arrested at gunpoint.</p> <p>Ahmed was a paranoid schizophrenic, Edmonson said. A note about the attack and a book about hostage negotiations, as well as other planning materials, were discovered at his residence.</p> <p>Edmonson said Ahmed planned the attack, and around midnight, he told police he was going to kill the hostages. State police then gave the order to initiate the raid.</p> <p>""This is certainly not the way I wanted this to end, but I believe his mind was set from the beginning,"" the state police superintendent said.</p> <p>No troopers were injured in the attack.</p> <p>Edmonson said a negotiator had spoken with Ahmed throughout the day, but Ahmed often hung up the phone. Robbery is not believed to have been a motive in the attack.</p> <p>""He was mad at people he said were mean to him,"" Edmonson said. ""He heard voices in his head and wanted a thing in his head removed.""</p> <p>The hostages were shot with a pistol, but Ahmed was also carrying a rifle.</p> <p>About 100 law enforcement personnel, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, a bomb squad and sheriff's deputies from four parishes, were assembled, and lights were brought in as negotiations dragged into the night.  A no-fly zone with a radius of 5 miles and up to 5,000 feet was imposed above the bank.</p> <p>Authorities blocked Louisiana 128, the main road that  runs through the town, the seat of Tensas Parish, southeast of Monroe and downriver from Vicksburg, Miss.</p> <p>Ahmed's family owns a convenience store in St. Joseph. The family, originally from Yemen, moved to Louisiana from California shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Tensas Parish Sheriff Rick Jones said he believed Ahmed executed his plan as he intended to do from the beginning.</p> <p>""Our parish now is in mourning,"" Jones said. ""It's a pretty heartbreaking thing.""</p> <p>Residents were unnerved by the massive police presence, which included a SWAT team.</p> <p>""It's kind of startling for the residents. We're not accustomed to this kind of activity,"" Richardo Miles, a 25-year-old farmworker, told the Associated Press. ""Some people are pretty scared. They're nervous.""</p> <p>Some have left town, the mayor said.</p> <p>""It's a quiet town. Very little crime. So this is amazing,"" he said.</p> <p>Contributing: William M.

After a brief chase, the male complied with officers and was arrested.</p> <p>A bucket containing more than $29,000 in cash, a 9 millimeter handgun, extra ammunition, zip ties and other items were recovered. The suspect refused to speak to officers and would not identify himself.</p> <p>A vehicle also was recovered and more ammunition, two more bags of zip ties, the suspect's ID card and other items were found.</p> <p>Arrested was Michael J. Fette, 46, whose last known address was Lancaster. He was arrested for aggravated robbery and transported to the Huron County Jail.</p> <p>Look for the full story in Tuesday's Norwalk Reflector.</p> <p>....and Im sure our local judicial system will slap him on his hands and tell him he can be put on probation if he promises to ""be good from here on out"".</p> <p>Think it's bad in Willard try Sandusky!!!  Sandusky is my hometown and moved back there a few years ago but I left last year and moved to Huron and will never go back!  Crime is way too bad.  Drugs and gangs are running the town and ruining!  Willard is bad too but it hasn't reached the level of Sandusky yet.  I hope it never does.</p> <p>What? No photos or extensive comments from the WPD chief or arresting officers. No big PR? If it were the Huron County SO there would be. The police department in Huron County consistently go about their business without fan fare. The Huron County SO stumbles onto a 2 balloon bust and there are 18 pictures and 2 articles, along with interviews citing how great a job was done by certain officers.</p> <p>I will lay my money on the idea that this was also some how DRUG related.  It is a sad thought that many of us are now questioning how safe it is to just run to the corner store.  Be it how safe you are on the street in your car, safe from a drunk driver, texting driver. Or how safe you are from being held up at gun point at the local grocery store.  America is in a sad state.  People are becoming desperate.  It only seems to be getting worse. No jobs or only low paying, few hour, no benefit jobs.  Everyone lives in their own little world, everyone for themselves.</p> <p>My guess is he knew this money would be there. $29,000 at a tiny grocer? Someone on the inside had to be involved. I don't understand why they would have that much cash on hand. Considering it was a Sunday I could understand a deposit not being made until Monday but $29,000???</p> <p>Don't hold your breath for more details.  It's the local paper.  We're not dealing with Woodward and Bernstein here.  It's Huron county.  He will get  a slap on the wrist and banned from entering the store.  Probably some CBCF thrown his way if he is lucky so he can receive some treatment for whatever ""disease"" forced him to commit this crime.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.923007"", ""count"": ""4"", ""type"": ""StateOrCounty"", ""text"": ""Huron County""}, {""relevance"": ""0.619448"", ""count"": ""3"", ""type"": ""City"", ""text"": ""Willard""}, {""relevance"": ""0.578768"", ""count"": ""6"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Michael J.

www.ohio.com/news/break-news/ohio-senator-backs-alternatives-to-gun-sales-bill-1.421295,Akron,OH,Ohio senator backs alternatives to gun sales bill,20130815T000000,"<p>CINCINNATI: Ohios Republican senator Thursday defended his opposition to legislation adding new gun sales restrictions, telling a national police officers conference there are better ways to combat gun violence.</p> <p>Sen. Rob Portman said the proposed expansion of background checks for online and private firearms sales wouldnt significantly impact gun violence and wouldnt have prevented such mass shootings as the elementary school slayings in Newtown, Conn.</p> <p>Instead, Portman said in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police national conference that the measures would add restrictions infringing upon the rights of law-abiding gun owners who arent the problem.</p> <p>We can do this in a way that addresses the fundamental problems, Portman said, saying some of his critics on the issue are pushing a political agenda. He noted that speakers on a national bus tour promoting gun-control measures have cited his vote. The tour, which has made stops in Ohio in recent days, is coordinated by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that includes Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory.</p> <p>Im not focused on the politics of it. Im focused on what will actually help to reduce gun violence and make our communities safer, Portman told reporters after his speech.</p> <p>People who are actually committing crimes with guns dont get their guns from those kinds of private sales, he said. He said he supports strengthening background checks with more information on mental health issues and targeting habitual offenders he says are responsible for the vast majority of gun crimes, among other steps. He also promoted Second Chance legislation to help people who have been in prison move back into society productively.</p> <p>Ohios Democratic Sen.

www.marionstar.com/usatoday/article/2929217,Marion,OH,Israeli girl wounded in attack in West Bank | The Marion Star | marionstar.com,20131005T000000,"<p>JERUSALEM (AP) - A 9-year-old Jewish girl was seriously injured in a suspected Palestinian militant attack while playing outside her home Saturday in a settlement in the West Bank, Israeli police said.</p> <p>Initial reports indicated the attack was carried out by a sniper but police said they were investigating all options, including the possibility that the Psagot settlement was infiltrated by a Palestinian militant.</p> <p>Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said residents were told to stay indoors while searches are underway.</p> <p>Danny Fink, a surgeon at Shaarei Tzedek hospital in Jerusalem, told Channel 2 TV that the girl was fully conscious when she was rushed in. ""According to what the girl said the terrorist was at close range,"" he said.</p> <p>He said it wasn't yet clear if the girl had sustained a bullet wound or a knife attack.</p> <p>Psagot spokesman David Tzviel told the station that the girl's family lives at the edge of the community near its security fence. He said the most likely scenario was that a Palestinian militant penetrated the settlement. The girl described being attacked by a man with a black mask, he said.</p> <p>Tensions are high between Israelis and Palestinians in the area.</p> <p>An Israeli soldier was recently shot and killed by a sniper in the West Bank city of Hebron. And in a separate incident a Palestinian was lured to the West Bank, and was killed by a Palestinian who wanted to trade the body for his brother who is serving time in an Israeli jail for shooting and bomb attacks.</p> <p>The spike in violence adds to the mistrust between Israel and the Palestinians, as the two sides hold negotiations that restarted this summer after a hiatus of nearly five years. Talks collapsed in 2008, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spent months early this year persuading the sides to get talks back on track again. Israel says security concerns are a top priority in negotiations.</p> <p>Earlier Saturday, a Palestinian farmer said vandals from another Israeli settlement in the West Bank damaged more than 100 olive trees as the annual harvest of the important crop begins.</p> <p>Yasser Fukha said he saw residents Shavei Shomron driving near the farm earlier this week and later found the trees damaged.</p> <p>For Palestinians the crop is more than a fruit to be consumed or sold, they view it as a symbol of their connection to the land. Every year they say settlers target their trees.</p> <p>Rosenfeld said Isralie police are looking into the report. The military said forces were sent to the scene to investigate.</p> <p>Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All   rights reserved.

www.marionstar.com/usatoday/article/2928321,Marion,OH,String of attacks in Iraq kills at least 66 | The Marion Star | marionstar.com,20131005T000000,"<p>BAGHDAD (AP) - A suicide bomber blew himself up among a crowd of Shiite pilgrims passing through a mainly Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad and another detonated his explosives inside a cafe north of the capital, the deadliest of several attacks across Iraq on Saturday that killed at least 66 people.</p> <p>The killings, which also included attacks on journalists and anti-extremist Sunni fighters, are part of the deadliest surge in violence to hit Iraq in five years. The accelerating bloodshed is raising fears that the country is falling back into the spiral of violence that brought it to the edge of civil war in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.</p> <p>The extent of the carnage from the evening attack on the pilgrims became clearer as midnight approached, when officials sharply revised the death toll upward to at least 42. Another 80 were reported injured.</p> <p>The bomber detonated his explosives at a checkpoint in the northern neighborhood of Azamiyah as the pilgrims en route to a prominent Shiite shrine in the nearby neighborhood of Kazimiyah, according to police officials. At least four policemen manning the checkpoint were among the dead, the officials said.</p> <p>Azamiyah and the Shiite district of Kazimiyah sit on opposite sides of the Tigris River that snakes through the Iraqi capital. Their proximity made them a key flashpoint for the widespread sectarian conflict that gripped Iraq after Saddam Hussein's ouster and peaked in 2006 and 2007. Authorities closed the bridge between the neighborhoods after hundreds of Shiite pilgrims died in a 2005 stampede sparked by fears of a suicide bomber, and reopened it in 2008.</p> <p>Around the same time, another suicide bomber blew himself up in a cafe in the town of Balad, a largely Shiite town surrounded by Sunni communities about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Baghdad. Balad Mayor Malik Lefta said at least 13 people were killed and 22 were wounded in that attack.</p> <p>He said the cafe was the same one hit by a deadly suicide bombing in August.</p> <p>A hidden bomb also exploded inside a cafe in the religiously mixed Baghdad neighborhood of Baiyaa, killing three people and wounding 13, police said.</p> <p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the day's violence. Al-Qaida's Iraq arm often deploys suicide bombers and targets Shiite civilians in an effort to undermine confidence in the Shiite-led government.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, gunmen shot dead a reporter and a cameraman for the privately owned al-Sharqiya TV channel while they were working on a report in the northern city of Mosul, according to police. The city is a former Sunni insurgent stronghold that has been one of the hardest areas of Iraq to tame.</p> <p>Al-Sharqiya identified the correspondent as Mohammed Karim al-Badrani and the cameraman as Mohammed Ghanem. It was not immediately clear why they were targeted.</p> <p>Al-Sharqiya is one of several independent channels that took to the airwaves following the 2003 ouster of former dictator Saddam Hussein. It has drawn the ire of the current Shiite-led government with critical reports highlighting corruption, poor services and other shortcomings. Authorities suspended its operating license along with those of eight other Iraqi channels and pan-Arab broadcaster Al-Jazeera in April after accusing them of inflaming sectarian tensions.</p> <p>The channel's news director, Ali Wajih, said in a phone interview that he had not received any information from Mosul police, and he hoped the killings would be investigated.</p> <p>""This is not new for al-Sharqiya. This is usual for Iraq, that they kill journalists,"" he said, adding that 16 of the channel's employees have been killed since 2003. Among them are four who were kidnapped and killed in 2008 while on assignment in Mosul.</p> <p>Iraq was the deadliest country in the world for journalists between 2003 and 2008. Although members of the media continue to face intimidation, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has not reported a murder of a journalist in the country since September 2011.</p> <p>At least six members of Sunni militias opposed to al-Qaida were also killed Saturday. The militiamen were members of the Sahwa, which joined U.S. troops in the fight against al-Qaida at the height of Iraq war. Its members have since been frequently targeted by Sunni insurgents, who consider them traitors.</p> <p>Gunmen attacked a two car convoy carrying local Sahwa leader Issa al-Sabeel in the predominantly Sunni town of Hawija, said police chief Col. Fattah Mahmoud Yassin. He said the militia leader survived but three of his bodyguards were killed.</p> <p>Hawija, 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad, was the scene of a deadly shooting at an anti-government protest by Iraqi security forces in April.</p> <p>A bomb also hit a checkpoint manned by Sahwa members in the town of Youssifiyah, south of the Iraqi capital, killing three of the fighters and wounding five other people, police said.</p> <p>Hospital officials confirmed the casualties provided by the unnamed police officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists.</p> <p>Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All   rights reserved.

www.neagle.com/article/20130822/NEWS/130829916,Hawley,PA,"Public prayer banned from WAHS graduation - News - News Eagle - Hawley, PA - Hawley, PA",20130822T000000,"<p>Religious expression by means of prayer said at Wallenpaupack graduation exercises will be curtailed, following an inquiry by the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF).</p> <p>That is despite a disqualifier placed every year in the inside front cover of the Commencement Program stating, ""The senior class has specifically requested that an Invocation and Benediction be included in their graduation ceremonies. The manner and content of this Invocation and Benediction is being directed by the class.""</p> <p>It is also in spite of history. Prayers have been allowed at the start and closing of Commencement since the early days of Hawley High School, which opened in 1879. Commencement for the Class of 2014, which apparently will not have an Invocation or Benediction, happens to be the 50th graduation since the present high school was opened.</p> <p>A parent of a Wallenpaupack Area High School student contacted the FFRF after the June 14th graduation with a complaint about the practice. At that graduation, Rev. Gregg Schafer of the Newfoundland Moravian Church gave the prayers.</p> <p>FFRF is a national nonprofit organization with over 19,000 members. The stated purpose of FFRF is to protect the constitutional principle of separation between church and state.</p> <p>Markert wrote that the Supreme Court has continually struck down prayers at school-sponsored events, including public school graduations. School officials may not invite a student, teacher, faculty member or clergy to pray at graduation at a public high school.</p> <p>""Students wishing to participate should not be forced to forgo this momentous occasion in their lives simply because Wallenpaupack Area High School deems it necessary to include prayer in the ceremony,"" she penned. ""We can agree that 'it is cruel to force any individual to violate his conscience to participate in such an important event in the individual's life'"" (again citing case law).</p> <p>Page 2 of 2 -  Calling on Wallenpaupack to remain neutral toward religion, the FFRF attorney asked for written assurance that steps will be taken to ensure that ""religious rituals"" are not part of graduation ceremonies or any other school-sponsored events in the future.</p> <p>Silsby informed the Board that legal opinion has been sought, and determined that even with the booklet disclaimer, the prayers are not acceptable in case law. He said that result is the District will no longer be able to schedule Invocation or Benediction. He said he would reply to the FFRF.</p> <p>The Superintendent explained afterward that the District had made the contacts for the students to invite the clergy member. Even if the students were to make the arrangements themselves, he said, case law would not support it.</p> <p>He affirmed that if the District were not to comply, the possibility of a court challenge would exist.</p> <p>Jo-Ann Rose, a Palmyra Township-Pike resident, commented, ""My son is graduating this year [Class of 2014]. I may have to make my own prayer."" She said she is appalled by the decison.</p> <p>Rev. Martin Cox, who retired from the pastorate at Hawley United Methodist Church last year, was invited by the School District in 2010 to pray at Commencment. ""It's regrettable,"" he said of the cancellation of further public prayers. ""But I'm not surprised by it."" He said that he was concerned about this back in the 1990's and cautioned the School Board and Superintendent who were in place then, that ""it was only a matter of time."" He said the reaction then was that there would be no problem. At the time, there wasn't a problem, he said, but warned that someone would eventually raise the issue of ""Church and State.""</p> <p>Asked about Baccalaureate Service, Silsby stated that participation at this traditional service, held at a different local church each year, has always been voluntary. Although the School District in the past helped make the contact, he said that the local ministerium will be offered to take over the arrangements.</p> <p>At the opening of the August School Board meeting, Chairman John Spall announced that they would be deviating from their normal offering of prayer prior to the Pledge of Allegiance.

www.neagle.com/article/20130919/NEWS/309199912,Hawley,PA,"TV Guide - Dexter: Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter Look Back on 8 Seasons of Kills and Thrills - News - News Eagle - Hawley, PA - Hawley, PA",20130919T000000,"<p>Page 2 of 8 - What was it about Dexter Morgan that made him a likable and relatable character?  Hall: Certainly the fact that he kills the kinds of victims he kills and that he doesn't just off people who look at him funny gives people permission to identify with him. He was compelling because he made the claim that he was without the capacity for human emotion and we were maybe meant to be suspicious of that. Even we thought he didn't have the full capacity, in spite of anything, he did seem to have the appetite; an appetite that was exploited by the Ice Truck killer (Christian Camargo). Over the course of the show, that appetite has been exploited again and again in different, deeper and dicier ways.</p> <p>What depths did you have to go to in order to play a serial killer? Hall: I'm someone who certainly is not opposed to doing a certain amount of research and certainly I'm interested in drawing in my own experience up to a point. But I do think that some of the appeal with Dexter is that it inevitably requires an imaginative leap unless I was willing to go out and actually off people and see what that felt like. I wasn't going to be able to know exactly what it was like to live his specific life. Frankly, if I did that it wouldn't really help much because it's not really my inclination. I have my compulsions, but it's definitely not that.</p> <p>How much did you relate to your character? Carpenter: From the beginning, I wouldn't say we were the same shape, really. We couldn't have been mistaken for each other, but I was as green as she was. When you're doing television, there's not a set date for it to end or a set story so you know exactly where you're taking it. I had to lend her pieces of me to survive and keep it honest in a way. I had to use my imagination to make her very separate and far from me as well. So it just became about isolating between one side or the other. Either I was working at something for myself or I was taking a vacation from myself and really luxuriating in this fictitious person.</p> <p>Talk about the evolution of Dexter and Debra.  Carpenter: When I look back on it, I'm aware that it wasn't easy. It wasn't a job where I was ever at rest. Creatively, I'm really grateful to that. But it wasn't like she made a pivot from season to season. It was like she was spinning in 360-degree circles again and again and she just couldn't find a place to stop. There was a part of me, just as the actor, that envied the voiceover. I wish Deb had one from time to time because I had no idea what to make of it. With the clock running and someone is going to say, ""Action"" momentarily, you have to just pull the trigger and make a decision. Often times that's what I was doing. I got to a place where I started to work with what really was in the room with me and often times that was fear and confusion and muscle. And often times I feel like those are also adjectives that can be used to describe Debra. There was something, by the end of it, something that was pure in the beginning, unfortunately became spoiled. I feel like I knew four seasons in that there was never going to be a happy ending for Deb. Hall: Over the course of the show, it's been about navigating the twists and turns in ways in which he has evolved or devolved. Playing the role has ultimately required a great deal of flexibility in terms of my initial conceptions and how those have been challenged and how they've had to morph over the life of the show.</p> <p>Page 3 of 8 - Was there a line you personally wouldn't cross on the series? Carpenter: When the conversation about Debra having feelings for her brother came up, there was talk about a scene where - you know the scene where they're having Chinese food and they kiss? That was originally going to be a love scene, and I absolutely was not going to do that, so that's the first thing that comes to mind. I renegotiated it down to a very swift kiss. Hall: For me, any kind of line drawing was more about how we did things. Sometimes we were missing something in terms of the connective tissue that I felt we needed to feel like we were maintaining some sense, or my own sense, of the character's truth. I always had as much of an appetite as anyone for him to go far and farther, to completely go unhinged and fly off the handle. But because we didn't want to just blow the things up or crash and burn, we had to have him maintain some sense of control over his world and himself.</p> <p>What has been your favorite moment on the series? Hall: There have been so many, but I always come back to Dexter discovering his origin story and doing that face plant into the room full of blood in the 10th episode of the first season. There was something about playing that scene and setting up all the cameras, we could only do it once because we were making such a mess.  Carpenter: There were a lot of scenes that I was afraid to play, like when Lundy (Keith Carradine) died in the parking lot scene, I was a mess. I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to play that scene. I didn't want to shoot LaGuerta (Lauren Velez). It was traumatic in a weird way. You're so far into the series, it becomes real to a certain extent. It hurt me personally to play those scenes. But they are, in turn, my favorites because with great risk comes rewards. They taught me so much about how important it is to work with good people.</p> <p>One of the most revealing scenes that I've played was with Quinn (Desmond Harrington) in the finale. We have a scene in the ambulance and it was the scene that left him for the series. As soon as we cut on it and it was over, it was as if the love that existed between these two characters was hovering between us and they could both see it, and it broke my heart. Because I don't know that I'll ever work with another actor that will go there the way that Desmond did.  Basically what I'm saying is I'm spoiled rotten. I guess every moment was my favorite because I feel like there were so many other actors that just didn't feel like getting out of bed to go to that audition that day and then I had a good day. The course of my life and this show could be very different.</p> <p>Who has been your favorite villain? Carpenter: John Lithgow, because he was a teddy bear to be around and a grizzly to work with.  Hall: Trinity (Lithgow), because he is the most complex, formidable and the most like Dexter in terms of the way he tried to live his life. And he's my favorite dramatically because the real marker is before and after Trinity kills Rita (Julie Benz). Before that point, Dexter could really operate under the reasonable assumption that he was not affecting those closest to him with what he was doing. Ever since, he's been scrambling to protect people from who he is.</p> <p>What was your favorite Deb curse word? Carpenter: It's kind of strange that you're asking me this question now because I'm sort of repulsed by all of it. At the gym this morning, Robin Thicke's song came on and someone mentioned it's possibly about date rape or something. It's called ""Blurred Lines"" and they repeat, ""You know you want it,"" again and again. That's so much of what's out there right now on the radio and television. It's just crude and disgusting and it infuriates me, to be honest. I have to justify it with Deb because it's her go-to tool and it was effective and it made people pay attention to her. It was a crutch really. It wasn't cheap, I guess is what I'm saying. So to go back and say ""I loved it when she said this F-bomb or this weird compound blending of two bad words"" makes it cheap and I would like to leave it thinking that it wasn't.</p> <p>Page 5 of 8 - What was the turning point of the series? Hall: [The Ice Truck killer and Rita's death] are fundamental early on. His discovery of his nature of his origins story, and that he's not alone, and that he has this brother, and that he has an appetite for a connection with him, and this may be trumped by his sense of connection with is sister: Those are all things when we meet Dexter at the beginning of the season he doesn't anticipate and isn't aware he has the capability to experience or appreciate.</p> <p>Certainly when Rita is killed - someone else in Dexter's world, a world that is being more and more characterized by seemingly legitimate connection, this is his wife with whom he has a child - someone else is implicated and whatever compartmentalization he had successfully cultivated starts to fall apart and those lines start to blur or disappear. Dexter's reeling from that throughout the rest of the series. Every season and every major relationship that Dexter has further exploits that there's a real appetite for connection and revelation. And in a way, the more he moves towards the light, the more the darkness is all the darker in stark relief. The more he becomes like a human, the darker it is to really consider the fact that he continues to kill.</p> <p>What is your reaction when fans say that Season 4 was the height of the series? Hall: I mean I get it. Like I said, he's just been reeling ever since Trinity got the best of him. He killed Trinity, so I guess he got the best of Trinity in a way, but he killed him with a lack of knowledge of what Trinity had really done. As the show initially presented some big adversary, Dexter would one way or another come to know and vanquish, that's the pinnacle of that model. The Trinity killing was the most prolific, formidable foe that Dexter ever faced.  Carpenter: What's funny is that maybe ignorance truly is bliss, because I really did somehow manage to be ignorant to the success of the show. Even when people say something to me now, I'm sort of skeptical, like, ""Who told you about the show?"" I can't imagine that people are actually watching it. So, was that the height of it? I don't know. I don't really give a lot of credit to people who make comments on the internet. I avoid it really. That's their business. If people think that was the height, then they're right because whatever the fans say goes.</p> <p>How do you feel about the final season going back to the beginning and looking at how the code was created? Hall:  I was never very interested in the show staying in the same place. Dexter could have gone more strict, hard and fast adherent to the code and we could have followed a similar formula and had a sort of ""Who's Dexter going to kill this week?"" be the primary question we were preoccupied with. But there was a desire to directly challenge the audience's affection for the character. Dexter is someone who had the code instilled in him by a father (James Remar) who arguably was a great dad, outside-of-the-box thinker, and on the other hand, abusive. Dexter has an impulse to rebel and his roles are not conventional roles. They're roles imposed by a self-appointed deity in the form of his father and, he comes to discover in the final season, in his spiritual mother (Charlotte Rampling). If he's going to rebel, he's going to rebel against the code and play faster and looser with his roles. He always, in the end, comes back to an appreciation for how it's protected him and kept him safe. But we don't always learn our lessons on time. Sometimes we learn them too late. Carpenter: Most years I was given the bare bones before we shot the first episode of each season. This year, I was told about what the first three episodes would look like. And the way that it was presented to me is that the rest is all up in the air. The rest was Dexter's business. So I didn't know and I didn't have Showtime because of the Time Warner thing. I turned it off. So I'm lost. I remember it as someone who lived it and not someone who studied it. I've never been confused about a season, but I'm confused about the end, and I think that might be a big sign for it being successful if that makes any sense.</p> <p>What are you hoping the audience will take away from the series? Hall: A sense that they've taken a ride that has been consistently compelling and cohesive and has started in one place and ended somewhere else. Different people like the show for different reasons. I just hope it's something that continually resulted in people leaning forward. I think it's done that.  Carpenter: It's a funny thing because it was the most amazing show. I feel like we are all huffing and puffing at the finish line. I feel like we all survived a marathon together. It's a strange thing to say to the audience, ""We ran for you. I hope you know we worked so hard for you."" So I hope they know that, although there may have been highs or lows throughout all eight seasons, which is something to be expected for something that goes that long, I hope they know it was sincere. I hope they know it was emotionally expensive for all of us. In a weird way, this could be totally off the mark, but I feel like Dexter, the series, sort of raised the bar for what cable television writing and storytelling could look like. I'm going to go ahead and believe that's true and I'm going to go ahead and be proud to have been a part of it. I hope they have better TV for it.</p> <p>How do you feel about saying goodbye to the character? Hall: I feel good about it. If you play a character long enough as an actor, your sense of acting and your sense of playing that specific character become fused in a way that it's sort of a mind bender so I'm glad to sort of disengage from this particular guy and move on to other things.</p>","[{""relevance"": ""0.824792"", ""count"": ""18"", ""type"": ""Person"", ""text"": ""Dexter Morgan""}, {""relevance"":

thetimes-tribune.com/news/west-pittston-couple-linked-to-aryan-brotherhood-held-for-trial-in-bath-salts-case-1.1519596,Scranton,PA,NA,NA,"<p>A West Pittston man who federal authorities say is the leader of a local chapter of the Aryan Brotherhood and his fiance will remain in jail on charges of conspiring to build a large-scale synthetic drug enterprise to sell a powerful, mind-altering substance throughout Luzerne County.</p> <p>Todd Morgans, 34, who federal authorities said used his West Pittston home to store and sell the synthetic drug, alpha-PVP, for the white supremacist group, appeared in federal court in Scranton on Friday for a detention hearing.</p> <p>After a deputy U.S. marshal removed his shackles, Mr. Morgans quietly conferred with his court-appointed attorney, Patrick M. Rogan, and decided to waive his right to a hearing.</p> <p>Mr. Rogan spoke on his behalf.</p> <p>Mr. Rogan reserved the right to request another hearing. There is no bail in the federal court system.</p> <p>The proceeding lasted mere minutes, in contrast to the detention hearing for his fiance, Christine Policare, 20, before U.S. District Judge Malachy E. Mannion.</p> <p>A federal grand jury indicted the couple on Tuesday on charges of possessing and trafficking at least 7,000 grams of alpha-PVP, which has chemical properties similar to another designer drug commonly known as bath salts.</p> <p>The day after the grand jury handed up the indictment, investigators raided Mr. Morgans' 217 Liberty St. home, where Ms. Policare also lives.</p> <p>They seized an estimated 2,000 grams of the synthetic drug, a stash of guns and ammo and roughly $40,000 in cash. During the raid, they encountered fortified doors and counter-surveillance equipment, which authorities believe was installed to help them evade law enforcement.</p> <p>They also found white supremacist literature and paraphernalia scattered throughout the home, which police said served as a meeting place for an Aryan Brotherhood chapter.</p> <p>Investigators are exploring the link between the couple's synthetic drug enterprise and the Aryan Brotherhood. They are also attempting to trace the source of the drug, which appears to have arrived in the U.S. from somewhere in Asia.</p> <p>Ms. Policare's public defender, Leo Latella, argued for her release from the county jail. He requested that she be placed under the care of her mother and put on electronic monitoring. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy C. Phillips asked the judge to deny his request.</p> <p>Ms. Policare carried out a large majority of the drug deals, Ms. Phillips said, adding that ""the evidence is overwhelming.""</p> <p>Her public defender said Ms. Policare was not the leader of the enterprise, just ""simply someone who was a hand-to-hand dealer. Simply taking orders.""</p> <p>Judge Mannion denied the request and ordered her to stay jailed pending the outcome of her case. She posed a threat to the community, the judge said, in part because authorities found guns and the white supremacist literature in the couple's home.</p> <p>Jury selection and trial are scheduled for Sept. 9. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.</p> <p>Contact the writer: smcconnell@ timesshamrock.com, @smcconnellTT on Twitter</p>",NA,NA
