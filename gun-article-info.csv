The jury then took a week off before returning Monday.</p> <p>A <span class=Keyword>federal appeals court</span> ordered a re-trial of Doody, who was convicted in 1993 and sentenced to <span class=Quantity>281 years</span> in prison, after concluding he was not properly advised of his rights.</p> <p>The retrial rests heavily on whether <span class=Keyword>jurors</span> believe the account of accomplice <span class=Person>Alex Garcia</span>, who pleaded guilty and is serving <span class=Quantity>271 years</span> in prison in exchange for avoiding a potential death sentence.</p> <p>Prosecutors argued that <span class=Person>Johnathan Doody</span>, then 17, and Garcia carefully planned the <span class=Crime>murder</span>s and robberies so that Doody could buy a Ford <span class=Automobile>Mustang</span>.</p> <p>Garcia was a <span class=Keyword>key witness</span> against Doody because little else <span class=Keyword>links Doody</span> to the slayings. During closing arguments, defense <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span> <span class=Person>Maria Schaffer</span> painted Garcia as a <span class=Keyword>master manipulator</span> and called him the devil, saying there would be no case against Doody without Garcias testimony.</p> <p>But <span class=JobTitle>prosecutor</span> <span class=Person>Jason Kalish</span> said Garcia has never wavered from his testimony in <span class=Quantity>22 years</span>.</p> <p>Everything he said was corroborated, Kalish said. He made a deal to tell the truth. He was honoring his deal. He honors his word.</p> <p>Detectives linked Garcia to the <span class=Keyword>slayings</span> through a Marlin .22 rifle that Garcia had borrowed from a friend. Forensics identified the rifle as the <span class=Crime>murder</span> weapon.</p> <p>But Garcia said it was Doody who used the gun and insisted there would be no witnesses to the <span class=Crime>robbery</span>. Kalish said Garcia used a shotgun during the slayings.

He is being tried in <span class=StateOrCounty>Cobb County</span> because of the amount of <span class=Keyword>news coverage</span> in <span class=StateOrCounty>Glynn County</span>, where the shootings occurred.</p> <p>Before Elkins <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span>s could resume their cross-examination of West, Judge <span class=Person>Stephen Kelley</span> ruled on a <span class=Keyword>prosecution motion</span> that had halted testimony Tuesday evening. He blocked the <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span>s from questioning <span class=Keyword>West</span> about any alleged drug use, sex for drugs or mistreatment of her older children a decade ago.</p> <p>Kelley concluded those allegations were not recent enough or similar enough to the childs death for defense <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span>s to bring up as ways to show someone else shot Antonio.</p> <p>The reason the court has to have these rules is boundaries, he said.</p> <p>He also denied <span class=Keyword>defense motions</span> to toss out the <span class=Keyword>individual charges</span> against Elkins and his mother, Karimah Elkins, 36, who is being tried on charges of providing a false alibi to police on his behalf and of evidence tampering.</p> <p>Kelley postponed seven <span class=Keyword>defense motions</span> for a mistrial for various reasons.</p> <p>During Wests final moments of cross-examination, she repeatedly batted away questions about whether she had changed her story in talking to the police and reporters or whether she had misidentified Elkins. To most questions she replied, I dont recall or possibly.</p> <p>I just remember identifying him and being sure, she said.</p> <p>The first <span class=Keyword>defense witness</span> was Wests <span class=Quantity>21-year</span>-old estranged daughter, <span class=Person>Ashley Glassey</span>, of <span class=City>Runnemede</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>N.J.</span>, who was released from a <span class=Keyword>New Jersey jail</span> on <span class=Crime>shoplifting</span> charges long enough to testify.</p> <p>During tearful testimony, <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> said she never met Antonio and hadnt seen her <span class=Keyword>mother</span> before Wednesday except briefly <span class=Quantity>four years</span> ago ever since <span class=Keyword>West</span> lost custody when <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> was 8. <span class=Keyword>West</span> called her the evening of the killing to give the news of her stepbrothers death.</p> <p>She asked me how long I thought it would take to get the <span class=FieldTerminology>life insurance policy</span>, the check to come, <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> said, explaining that she was familiar with insurance after having recently handled her grandmothers affairs.</p> <p>That night, <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> had trouble sleeping because in the retelling over the phone <span class=Keyword>West</span> had changed the order of who was shot first, <span class=Keyword>mother</span> or child. It bothered <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> enough to call <span class=City>Brunswick</span> police, who never returned the call or investigated, according to the testimony.</p> <p>Some things she said to me just didnt add up, <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> said. I felt like I got blown off (by police).</p> <p>West sat ramrod straight in the second row of the audience, wringing her hands, as <span class=Keyword>Glassey</span> told how her <span class=Keyword>mother</span> had memory problems and instructed her not to talk to reporters.</p> <p>The next <span class=Keyword>defense witness</span> was <span class=Person>Linda Knight</span>, a retired speech pathologist who lived across the street from the shooting scene. She said she was in the rear of her house when she heard three gunshots and ran to the front door, which opens onto London Street.</p> <p>I couldnt see anything, she said, adding that only the stroller handle and Wests head were visible behind some shrubs.</p> <p>Im sorry if I said it the wrong way, she apologized to defense <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span> <span class=Person>Kevin Gough</span>.</p> <p>She said that her daughter had been able to see more of the scene.</p> <p>The defense is expected present a deposition from a man who rode up on a bicycle shortly after the shooting and used a cellphone Knights daughter had but was too panicked to call 911.</p> <p>We know he is guilty, we just have to wait for the jury to say so. His punishment should be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But do not put him in front of a firing squad, instead have an <span class=Keyword>electronic firing device</span> attached to a pistol, restrain him hand and foot, and bind him where no movement would be possible. Why do this, you ask? The baby he shot did not know he was about to be shot, and did not know to try to get out of the way, but this <span class=Keyword>low life piece</span> of human debris knows to try to get out of the way. Set the timer on the device to pull the trigger at random, and make sure it is aimed at his heart. Cruel and unusual punishment, you say? Not as cruel as shooting a defenseless baby. Besides, someone like this piece of scum would not make it in prison. So save the money and eliminate the problem.</p> <p>your honor my client is just a ""po boy who lost his father"" and because of racism and slavery causing him to lash out because the child and his <span class=Keyword>mother</span> have white skin.  he didn't mean to kill the child but my client is innocent of <span class=Crime>murder</span> due to racism and slavery, and thatg he should be given a pass, <span class=Quantity>40 acres</span> and a mule, plus a <span class=Quantity>million dollars</span> becasue his ancestors were slaves......folks this will be the defense for this animal when the only just compensation should be a .<span class=Quantity>45 slug</span> to the back of the head for him and his sorry azz welfare, parasitic, broodmare mammy...</p>",Defense setbacks in toddler-slaying trial | The Augusta Chronicle,8/28/2013,"Ashley Glassey, Sherry West, DeMarquise Elkins, Stephen Kelley, Antonio Santiago, Linda Knight, Kevin Gough","Runnemede, Brunswick","Cobb County, Glynn County, N.J."

Police later found the boy wounded in the SUV at the intersection of <span class=Keyword>17th Avenue</span> and Virginia Street. He died from <span class=Keyword>gunshot wounds</span> to the chin and pelvis.</p> <p>In the days after the crime, Gary police questioned the boy's father, <span class=Person>Terry L. Bethel</span>, and named him a person of interest in the case. In July 2010, Shaw filed a <span class=FieldTerminology>civil lawsuit</span> against Bethel and his brother <span class=Person>Joe Noel</span>, alleging the two caused Josiah's death.</p> <p>Carter's office has reviewed allegations that someone attempted to falsely take a <span class=Keyword>paternity test</span> for Bethel.</p> <p>Neither Bethel nor Noel has been charged in the shootings.</p> <p>The newlook at the <span class=FieldTerminology>criminal case</span> comes as Noel was interviewed Monday as part of the civil suit. The suit initially was set to go to trial Monday, but was postponed in July when Shaw's lawyer, <span class=Person>Darnail Lyles</span>, requested more time to gather evidence.</p> <p>The men's <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span>, <span class=Person>Scott King</span>, said of the case, ""I don't think any <span class=Keyword>additional evidence</span> has been developed to contest our contention that neither Mr. Noel, nor anybody related to or associated with him, is in any way responsible for this tragedy.""</p> <p>Lyles said Kwana Shaw's determination has not wavered in her pursuit of justice for her son.</p> <p>""She has not relented in her desire to have this go forward, either civilly or criminally,"" Lyles said.</p> <p>Whether or when a <span class=FieldTerminology>criminal case</span> will be filed has been the subject of speculation for years. The Shaws and supporters have expressed frustration at the lack of charges, pursuing their own civil justice. Meanwhile, Carter has said more work is needed to build a <span class=Keyword>strong case</span> worthy of a courtroom.</p> <p>""If we felt there was sufficient evidence, we would've charged a long time ago,"" Carter said. Carter said he is hoping Major Crimes can help assess what additional work may be needed to solidify the case.</p> <p>Lyles noted the level of burden of proof in a <span class=Keyword>civil case</span> is much lower than that of a criminal one. He said he has other matters he wants to investigate after Monday's deposition before preparing for a trial.</p>","Toddler's killing getting new review, 5 1/2 years later",9/11/2013,"Josiah Shaw, Bernard Carter, Darnail Lyles, Joe Noel, GARY, Terry L.

That's a <span class=Keyword>nationwide rate</span> of 1.17 homicides per 100,000 females, compared with <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span>'s rate of 1.77.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span>'s neighbors ranked lower, including <span class=City>Washington</span> which had a rate of 1.02, <span class=StateOrCounty>Montana</span> at 0.81, and <span class=StateOrCounty>Oregon</span> at 1.13.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>study results</span> don't surprise <span class=Person>Susan Koerner</span>, who is a <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> victims' advocate - among other duties - for the <span class=StateOrCounty>Kootenai County</span> <span class=JobTitle>prosecutor</span>'s office. She believes <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span>'s ranking is fair.</p> <p>""Our area has some of the <span class=Keyword>highest rates</span> of <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> in the state of <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span>, which also has very <span class=Keyword>high rates</span> of <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span>,"" Koerner said.</p> <p>""Thankfully there have not been many <span class=Crime>murder</span>s, (but) we have had many cases of attempted strangulation which are very serious and could lead to death,"" Koerner said.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span> had 14 <span class=Keyword>female homicide victims</span> (in single-victim-single-offender cases) in 2011, while <span class=City>Washington</span> had 35, <span class=StateOrCounty>Montana</span> had four and <span class=StateOrCounty>Oregon</span> had 22.</p> <p>""There is still a culture in our state that this is just a <span class=Keyword>family problem</span> and the government doesn't need to be involved in these situations,"" Koerner said. ""<span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span> has been greatly affected by the recession and <span class=Keyword>women</span> have not been calling in to report <span class=Keyword>early incidents</span> of <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span>. They are waiting until their injuries can be life-threatening to make a call to <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> or the local shelter.""</p> <p>Nationwide, for homicides in which the <span class=Keyword>victim-to-offender relationship</span> could be identified, <span class=Quantity>94 percent</span> of <span class=Keyword>female victims</span> were <span class=Crime>murder</span>ed by a male they knew.</p> <p>For the homicides in <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span> in which the weapon used could be identified, <span class=Quantity>75 percent</span> were committed with guns, and <span class=Quantity>93 percent</span> (13 out of 14) of the <span class=Keyword>women</span> were <span class=Crime>murder</span>ed by someone they knew.</p> <p>One of those <span class=Crime>murder</span>s was committed by <span class=Person>Joseph Herrera</span> in <span class=City>St. Maries</span> on <span class=Holiday>Christmas day</span> 2011. He shot and killed his girlfriend, <span class=Quantity>18-year</span>-old <span class=Person>Stefanie Comack</span>, during an argument.</p> <p>The recent report was completed by the <span class=Organization>Violence Policy Center</span>, in <span class=City>Washington</span>, <span class=Keyword>D.C. The center</span> is a <span class=Keyword>national educational organization</span> working to stop gun death and injury.</p> <p>""The sad reality is that <span class=Keyword>women</span> are nearly always <span class=Crime>murder</span>ed by someone they know,"" <span class=Person>Kristen Rand</span>, the center's legislative <span class=JobTitle>director</span>, said in a news release.</p> <p>""Nine <span class=Keyword>women</span> each week are shot to death by their husband or intimate <span class=JobTitle>partner</span>,"" said <span class=Person>Shannon Watts</span>, <span class=JobTitle>founder</span> of <span class=Keyword>Moms Demand Action</span> for Gun Sense in <span class=Continent>America</span>.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>South Carolina</span> topped the center's list with 2.54 <span class=Crime>murder</span>s of females by males per 100,000 females. <span class=StateOrCounty>Alaska</span> had a rate of 2.01, and <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span> was at 1.99, for second and third, respectively, on the list.</p> <p><span class=Person>MIke</span>, the <span class=Organization>Bible</span> is emphatic on how husbands are to treat their wives.  I suggest you look at Ephesians 5:22-25 and 1 Cor 13.  Christ never, never said to abuse your wife or your children.  He asked husbands to love their wife as much and if not more than themselves.  Christ knew that men and <span class=Keyword>women</span> were different.  Men need respect for who they are, they need to feel appreciated for the work they do and <span class=Keyword>women</span> need kindness and love from their husbands.  Abuse, eventually leading to <span class=Crime>murder</span> is not part of the <span class=Organization>Bible</span>. Have you seen abuse?.  Have you seen a women's body loaded with cigarette burns in places where the average person cannot see?.  Some men are clever about how and where they abuse their women.  Have you seen the broken arms, black eyes, strangulation marks on their necks? I have.  Jesus Christ does not equate abuse with being subject to their husbands.  Are you subject to your boss?  Where you subject to your parents growing up? Do you equate subject with abuse? Read the above verses and you can tell this blog whether Men can abuse their wives based on those readings.</p> <p>I looked at the 2010 statistics and <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span> was ranked 22nd with a rate of 1.28 per 100,000 for this single victim - single offender figure. That year there were 10 such victims so even a couple of <span class=Keyword>extra homicides</span> of this type can skew the annual statistics. It is hard to know if such cultural factors are present as the article suggests unless you make the argument as I would that is not an <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span> specific characteristic but rather a nationwide issue. Still, it is getting better as nationwide this number has trended downward over the years. Kudos to all who are helping keep this crime even rarer.</p>",These numbers are deadly - Coeur d'Alene Press: Local News,9/30/2013,"Susan Koerner, Joseph Herrera, Kristen Rand, Stefanie Comack, MIke, Shannon Watts","Washington, St. Maries","Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Kootenai County, South Carolina, Alaska, Oklahoma"

Im glad they changed it, said <span class=Organization>Argentine Township Police</span> <span class=Person>Chief Dan Allen</span>.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>self defense</span> act removed the <span class=Keyword>duty</span> to retreat in what Judge <span class=Person>Mark McCabe</span> of the <span class=Organization>67th District Court</span> describes as a few narrow exceptions.</p> <p>Both <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> and <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> statutes require the <span class=Keyword>person</span> using <span class=Keyword>potentially deadly force</span> to not be committing a crime at the time. The <span class=Keyword>person</span> must also not use the force against someone who is otherwise supposed to be there  like a <span class=Keyword>person</span> who lives in the same home.</p> <p>In either state, the <span class=Keyword>person</span> must believe that they, or someone nearby, is in <span class=Keyword>imminent danger</span> of death, great bodily harm or sexual <span class=Crime>assault</span>, and the use of <span class=Keyword>potentially deadly force</span> is needed to stop the attack.</p> <p>The term stand your ground is not in the <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> statute. The <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> law is titled Justifiable use of force, and is similar in size to the <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> law.</p> <p>McCabe cant recall any <span class=Keyword>specific cases</span> where the <span class=Keyword>self defense</span> law was used or cited, but hes sure it has been discussed, but more so with misdemeanor cases.</p> <p><span class=Person>Det. Sgt. Julie Bemus</span> of the <span class=Organization><span class=Person>Holly</span> Police Department</span> said in the <span class=Quantity>seven years</span> shes been in <span class=Person>Holly</span>, she has not seen anyone defend themselves with deadly force inside the village of <span class=Person>Holly</span>.</p> <p>Im glad that it hasnt happened, she said. If such a case would have occurred, she would have investigated it, and made sure the <span class=Keyword>actual law</span> was followed.</p> <p>Bemus said it wasnt their place as police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s to judge the laws themselves  just to enforce them. But then she said, I have to protect my family and I have to protect my children, and every citizen has a right to protect themselves in their home. I do the same thing at work, I protect others.</p> <p>Allen has seen a <span class=Keyword>similar defense</span> used while working with the <span class=Organization>Flint Police Department</span>. Shop owners would use deadly force during a <span class=Crime>robbery</span>, and although <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> was still a <span class=Keyword>duty</span> to retreat state at the time, the <span class=Keyword>shop owners</span> could still argue <span class=Keyword>self defense</span> successfully.</p> <p>I think people should have a right to defend themselves within reason, said Allen. He said that once a <span class=Keyword>person</span> who was previously in danger, and has since gotten control of the situation has a <span class=Keyword>duty</span> to stop using that potentially deadly force.</p> <p>Allen said that police have a <span class=Keyword>duty</span> to de-escalate a situation once its under control. Police are legally allowed to use force that is one step above the threat before them  for example if an assailant has a knife, its appropriate to use firearms.</p> <p>This isnt necessarily true with regular citizens. For example, if facing an <span class=Keyword>unarmed assailant</span> in a fight, simply picking up a stick can be considered felonious <span class=Crime>assault</span>  a <span class=Quantity>four-year</span> felony. A gun cant be brought to bear against an unarmed <span class=Keyword>person</span> in self defense, unless the other <span class=Keyword>person</span> has a great advantage physically, and they are losing a fight, potentially for their life.</p> <p>As a police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>, and self-defense <span class=JobTitle>instructor</span> for decades, Allen has strong feelings about <span class=Keyword>self defense</span> and the application of the laws.</p> <p>A death of a human being is homicide, he said, whether that be justifiable homicide, or manslaughter, based on the facts of the case. If a <span class=Keyword>person</span> is killed, whether it was self-defense, the courts will look at it later. The <span class=Keyword>self defense</span> act will not immediately absolve anyone of a crime, but it will give the <span class=FieldTerminology>district attorney</span> a reason to not bring up charges, or should a trial occur, an argument for the defense.</p> <p>Though parallels can be drawn between <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> and <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> law, Allen said theyre not quite the same. <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span>s a little different, he said. Its not <span class=StateOrCounty>Texas</span> for sure.</p>","Do we live in a stand your ground state? - Tri-County Times: News For Fenton, Linden, Holly MI",8/27/2013,"Chief Dan Allen, Det. Sgt.

www.houghtonlakeresorter.com/news/2013-08-29/News/Grosbeak_Blvd_to_be_mowed.html,Houghton_Lake,MI,"<p>After years of discussion and court cases, the <span class=Keyword>road end</span> at <span class=Keyword>Grosbeak Boulevard</span> has been deemed a public space. With the determination, the <span class=Organization>Grosbeak Boulevard Association</span> has requested that the <span class=Keyword>area</span> be mowed to allow for easier access.</p> <p>During a <span class=Organization><span class=StateOrCounty>Roscommon County</span> Road Commission</span> meeting on Aug. 22, the board approved the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> staff to mow the area. The <span class=Keyword>initial mow</span> will cost <span class=Quantity>$3,800</span> as <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> Manager Tim ORourke said its almost impossible to traverse this area.</p> <p>The first mow will take place on Sept. 9 and an annual budget of <span class=Quantity>$1,000</span> can be spent on mowing the area. ORourke said <span class=City>Gerrish Township</span> will initially pay for the cost of mowing and then be reimbursed by the association.</p> <p>In the past, the <span class=Keyword>area</span> was moved by an association member if it was mowed at all. Member <span class=Person>Kim Akin</span> was concerned that the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> would be mowing the area.</p> <p>I dont know that thats something we want to be involved in, Akin said.</p> <p>ORourke said he was comfortable with the staff mowing the <span class=Keyword>area</span> and all five members voted in favor of the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> mowing Grosbeak Boulevard.</p> <p>The board addressed another <span class=Keyword>road end</span> issue as <span class=Keyword>Brown Street</span> resident <span class=Person>Meryln Niles</span> addressed the board on large rocks and slabs of concrete at the end of the road. Niles told the board because of the concrete at the end of the road he was having trouble figuring out the best place to position a dock as he also had questions on the roads right of way.</p> <p>Nobody wants to assist in clearing the debris, Niles said as he has also addressed the issue with <span class=City><span class=Facility>Roscommon Township</span></span> and the <span class=Organization>Department of Natural Resources</span>.</p> <p>ORourke said the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> staff would go to the <span class=Keyword>road end</span> and determine the best way to address the built up rock and concrete. He added once the staff gets to the road they will determine if its best to <span class=FieldTerminology>break up</span> the concrete and either reinsert the broken up rock back with the existing rock or remove whatever does not fit.</p> <p>Regarding a question of the <span class=Keyword>Brown Street</span> right of way ORourke said <span class=City><span class=Facility>Roscommon Township</span></span> could pay up to <span class=Quantity>$500</span> to have posts installed indicating the perimeters of the road. ORourke told Niles it would be up to the township to determine if it wanted to pay for the posts. ORourke also told Niles the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> would not make a recommendation on where to place his dock as he should refer to the <span class=City><span class=Facility>Roscommon Township</span></span> dock ordinance.</p> <p>In other news, ORourke will be meeting with the <span class=Organization>Michigan Department of Transportation</span> to address MDOTs desire to reduce the number of <span class=Keyword>winter patrol employees</span> from two to one person. ORourke said it isnt feasible to have only one <span class=Keyword>night patrol person</span> as <span class=StateOrCounty>Roscommon County</span> can have <span class=Keyword>varying snow patterns</span> at the same time.</p> <p>Nobody likes this, nobody wants to have one person, ORourke said.</p> <p>ORourke also address the selling of a 3/<span class=Quantity>4 ton</span> truck to <span class=City><span class=City>Richfield</span> Township</span>. He was informed by <span class=City>Richfield</span> <span class=JobTitle>Supervisor</span> <span class=Person>Jim VanWormer</span> that the <span class=Keyword>township board</span> approve the spending of up to <span class=Quantity>$7,000</span> for the truck. ORourke said he felt it best to refuse the offer as the Kelly <span class=FieldTerminology>Blue Book</span> value is <span class=Quantity>$11,000</span>. He added he would only accept <span class=Quantity>$11,000</span> for the truck as it could be placed in the annual equipment auction.</p> <p>The board also passed a resolution in support of <span class=GeographicFeature>Houghton Lake</span> resident <span class=Person>Jack McCauley</span>s effort to have the dredged holes of <span class=GeographicFeature>Houghton Lake</span> marked with buoys.</p> <p>The next regular <span class=Organization><span class=Company>RCRC</span></span> meeting will be held Sept.12 at 7 p.m.</p>",Grosbeak Blvd. to be mowed | www.houghtonlakeresorter.com | Houghton Lake Resorter,8/29/2013,"Tim ORourke, Meryln Niles, Kim Akin, Jack McCauley, Jim VanWormer","Roscommon Township, Gerrish Township, Richfield Township, Richfield",Roscommon County

""Calling this a gun-free space won't stop a crazy person.""</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>group</span> of roughly 20 active members out of the almost 900 <span class=Keyword>students</span> in their section wants to invite others to join the conversation.</p> <p>A <span class=Keyword>group</span> of <span class=Keyword>students</span> has been discussing similar topics since 2011, but becoming an <span class=JobTitle>official</span> club allows them to reach out to more students, club <span class=JobTitle>official</span>s said. They want to dispel misconceptions about <span class=Keyword>concealed carry</span> in general and on college campuses, as well as promote conversation to change policy.</p> <p>Changing policy is not to say that every student will be carrying a gun, however, Huff said. The goal is to allow those with <span class=Keyword>concealed weapons permits</span> to carry on campus, just like most public places.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> law prohibits <span class=Keyword>concealed carry</span> weapons in all classrooms and dormitories. <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span>, like almost all colleges in <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span>  except <span class=StateOrCounty>Michigan</span> State University  extends the ban to the entire campus.</p> <p>""We recognize that university policy can't change overnight,"" Huff said. ""We really want to promote discussion.""</p> <p><span class=Person>Flint</span> Mayor <span class=Person>Dayne Walling</span>, who is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns which aims to prevent gun violence, said he agreed with the <span class=Keyword>current university policy</span> of prohibiting firearms.</p> <p>The university has already made a determination about its policy based on safety of its <span class=Keyword>students</span> and campus, Walling said. I think each institution has the responsibility of setting policies for the <span class=FieldTerminology>public health</span> of their staff and students.</p> <p>Even though <span class=Person>Flint</span> is ranked the most violent city in the nation, <span class=Organization><span class=Company>KSCC</span></span> members say the <span class=Keyword>group</span> isnt about violence in the area. In fact, there are many reports of <span class=Keyword>college campuses</span> being safer than other public areas, the <span class=Keyword>club board members</span> said.</p> <p>They want to promote <span class=Keyword>concealed carry</span> on <span class=Keyword>campus</span> to give students, faculty and staff the right to carry concealed weapons just like other <span class=Keyword>public areas</span> and for self-defense in case something does happen. Concealed carry would be allowed only for those who have gone through the proper training to receive their Concealed Pistol License.</p> <p><span class=Organization><span class=Company>KSCC</span></span> stems from the national <span class=Keyword>group</span> <span class=Organization>Students for Concealed Carry</span>, which claims more than 43,000 college students, professors, staff and citizens involved. According to the national groups website, <span class=Keyword>group</span> <span class=JobTitle>official</span>s say its not fair to make <span class=Keyword>concealed carry</span> on campuses off limits just because colleges are safer places.</p> <p>The mass shooting that took place <span class=Organization>Virginia Tech</span> in 2007 was cited as an example of what can happen even when guns are prohibited on campus.</p> <p>While it may be safe to say colleges overall are less prone to crime than national averages, these numbers are useless in determining an individuals personal vulnerability to <span class=Crime>robbery</span> or rape, or a <span class=Keyword>campus</span> vulnerability to mass shootings, the <span class=Organization>Students for Concealed Carry</span> website states.</p> <p>In the near future, the <span class=Organization><span class=Person>Flint</span> club</span> hopes to organize a <span class=Keyword>town hall meeting</span> with speakers from both sides of the issue and invite the <span class=Keyword>campus</span> community to join.</p> <p>""As part of the college experience, <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> University encourages all of its <span class=Keyword>students</span> to engage in causes and issues that they are passionate about,"" said Betsy Homsher, <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> University <span class=JobTitle>vice <span class=JobTitle>president</span></span> of student life and dean of students. ""As an institution, we are always open to hearing feedback from <span class=Keyword>students</span> and we take those concerns seriously.""</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>group</span> meets Tuesdays around noon in the <span class=Facility>Sunset Cafe</span> inside the <span class=Facility>Campus Center</span>. The <span class=Keyword>group</span> has seen an increase in interest and participation since becoming a club, said <span class=Person>Dan Keys</span>, club <span class=JobTitle>president</span>.</p> <p>The <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> <span class=Organization>Students for Concealed Carry</span> <span class=Company>Facebook</span> <span class=Keyword>group</span> has more than 150 members and more people have reached out to the club, he said.</p> <p>The club hopes to not only discuss policy at <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> but also address state and national policies.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Sept. 3, the <span class=Keyword>group</span> plans an Empty Holster Protest, in which members will walk around <span class=Keyword>campus</span> wearing empty holsters, while talking about club's position.</p> <p>""It demonstrates that when are around this campus, we are defenseless,"" said Keys, 22, of Northville.</p> <p>In general, there is often a fear of the word ""gun,"" Huff said. The <span class=Keyword>group</span> hopes to defuse the fear and educate the <span class=Keyword>campus</span> community on <span class=Keyword>concealed carry</span> laws and initiatives.</p> <p>Looking at <span class=StateOrCounty>Genesee County</span> as a whole, the interest in <span class=Keyword>Concealed Pistol Licenses</span> (CPLs) is growing.</p> <p>The number of CPLs in <span class=StateOrCounty>Genesee County</span> has increased steadily over the years, said Doreen Fulcher, <span class=StateOrCounty>Genesee County</span> elections supervisor. In 2008, there were 2,405 CPL applicants. That increased to 5,083 in 2012.</p> <p>In January of this year there were 787 applications, which is up from 427 in January of 2011.</p> <p><span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> sophomore <span class=Person>Hunter Casbeer</span> was a class representative for <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> Student Government when the <span class=Keyword>group</span> proposed the idea.</p> <p>Everyones reaction was Whoa, are they wanting to get <span class=Keyword>students</span> to carry guns on campus?  said Casbeer, 20. It was sort of a shock to the people on the <span class=Organization>Senate</span> at least.</p> <p>Their goals from what Casbeer gathered was to raise awareness and allow <span class=Keyword>campus</span> officers to carry guns, which he thought was a good idea.</p> <p>But he doesn't believe it would be a <span class=Keyword>good idea</span> to have <span class=Keyword>students</span> carry guns on campus.</p> <p>But <span class=Keyword>students</span> would be a different story. I think it would cause more trouble. I couldnt see <span class=Keyword>students</span> doing it,"" he said. I honestly couldnt see any reason for them to be carrying it. I feel like its pretty safe throughout <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span>.</p> <p>Freshman <span class=Person>Shaun Smith</span>, however, is in support of carrying concealed weapons on campus.</p> <p>I think it would be nice, because then people could learn to defend themselves in bad situations. Learning how to properly handle a gun is a good idea, in my opinion,"" Smith said.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>group</span> also hopes to host classes where experts talk about firearm safety, safety tips and the law.</p> <p>Not everyone in <span class=City><span class=StateOrCounty>Kettering</span></span> <span class=Organization>Students for Concealed Carry</span> has their CPL, but they all have interest in discussing policy change.</p> <p>""Why should you feel any different on a college <span class=Keyword>campus</span> than in public?"" asked <span class=Person>Blaise Friery</span>, a member of the <span class=Organization><span class=Company>KSCC</span></span>.</p>",New Kettering University student club wants to carry concealed guns on Flint campus,8/29/2013,"Kaity Huff, Dayne Walling, Dan Keys, Hunter Casbeer, Shaun Smith, Flint, Blaise Friery","Kettering, FLINT","Genesee County, Kettering, Michigan, MI"

After pleading with him to let her up, she attempted to free herself and was punched in the face three times by Mr. <span class=Keyword>Damon</span> before one of the other men stopped him (on video).</p> <p>We believe that this sets a dangerous precedent, as it regards citizens' arrests and especially women's rights, in cases where men may attempt to arrest and detain women.  This case should be carefully investigated and Mr. <span class=Keyword>Damon</span> should be prosecuted for his abuse of this young lady.</p> <p>In response to the petition, several who signed mention the controversial <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> prosecution of <span class=Person>George Zimmerman</span>, who was acquitted of <span class=Crime>murder</span> charges in the shooting of <span class=Person>Trayvon Martin</span>.</p> <p>The petition was initiated by <span class=Quantity>39-year</span>-old Muhammad, who says he does not know anyone involved, but was moved to start the petition after seeing the video on MLive and seeing the comments following the online article.</p> <p>It disturbed me that so many looked at it and saw nothing wrong with it, said Muhammad, an engineering <span class=JobTitle>technician</span>. ""Even if she committed a crime, she still has <span class=FieldTerminology>human rights</span>.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Kent County</span> <span class=Person>Commissioner Candace Chivis</span>, D-Grand Rapids, wrote a letter to <span class=StateOrCounty>Kent County</span> <span class=JobTitle>Prosecutor</span> William <span class=Keyword>Forsyth</span> expressing her concerns.</p> <p>In my opinion, after having viewed the video twice, I do feel that the lawyer was in the wrong and you can clearly see that he is enjoying hitting the woman and he was probably not detaining her correctly and that's why she bit him,"" Chivis wrote in an email to Forsyth.</p> <p>You can also see that only because another guy steps in and stops him from hitting her does he stop. But, as far as I can see, all of that is just very disturbing and not illegal, Chivis wrote. I am not sticking up for the purse-snatcher, I am just wondering what actually constitutes <span class=Crime>assault</span> regarding a citizen's arrest.</p> <p>Forsyth said he has no plans to prosecute Damon, whom he said was completely justified in his actions.</p> <p>I hate to disappoint them, <span class=Keyword>Forsyth</span> said. They can bring the petition here, but it wont result in a prosecution.</p> <p>Forsyth said if anything, <span class=Keyword>Damon</span> should be commended for doing more than just standing by and watching as a crime occurs.</p> <p>Why she bit him and what his feelings were at the time he hit her are speculative and have no bearing on my decision not to prosecute him for his actions, <span class=Keyword>Forsyth</span> said.</p> <p>Forsyth said it is clear that <span class=Keyword>Damon</span> is stopping the woman from injuring him.</p> <p>Somehow, Im supposed to prosecute him for that? <span class=Keyword>Forsyth</span> said. Im not charging him with anything.</p> <p>Chivis said she is satisfied from a legal standpoint that <span class=Keyword>Damon</span> could not be prosecuted.</p> <p>I think there should be clearer rules for what can be done in a citizens arrest, Chivis said. I think he should be told by <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> that what he did was wrong. But I think that legally, <span class=Person><span class=JobTitle>Prosecutor</span> Forsyth</span> was right. There's very <span class=Keyword>little legal recourse</span> because she was committing a felony and he was detaining her.</p> <p>Muhammad said he sees Forsyths response as symptomatic of American society.</p> <p>Im not surprised or shocked by (Forsyths) response, There are some class lines and racial lines that impact how we see this.</p> <p>E-mail <span class=Person>Barton Deiters</span>: <span class=EmailAddress>bdeiters@mlive.com</span> and follow him on <span class=Company>Twitter</span> at twitter.com/GRPBarton or <span class=Company>Facebook</span> at facebook.com/bartondeiters.5</p>",Petition drive seeks criminal charges against man who stopped alleged purse snatcher,10/1/2013,"Jonathan Damon, Prosecutor Forsyth, Commissioner Candace Chivis, Robert Muhammad, Mikayla Hull, Barton Deiters, George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin",GRAND RAPIDS,"Kent County, MI, Florida"
www.crookstontimes.com/article/20131001/NEWS/310019971/1664/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE,Crookston,MN,"<p>Between the <span class=Movie>Dark Knight</span> films, Teen Titans Go!, and the Amell-icousness of Arrow, <span class=City>DC</span> Comics and <span class=Company><span class=City>DC</span> Entertainment</span> have given us a lot to be happy about lately. Now they're giving <span class=Keyword>fans</span> the chance to score some sweet, once-in-a-lifetime goodies and do some serious good with ""We Can Be Heroes,"" the comic-book empire's ongoing charity-giving <span class=Keyword>campaign</span> benefiting hunger-relief groups in the Horn of <span class=Continent><span class=Country>Africa</span></span>. Built around members of the <span class=Organization>Justice League</span>, each week in this latest leg of the <span class=Company>WCBH</span> push features <span class=Keyword>perks</span> like set visits, signed books and other awesome swag, all up for grabs to goodhearted folks who donate to the cause. Here, <span class=City>DC</span> <span class=Keyword>Comics creative chief</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> <span class=Person>Geoff Johns</span>, and Arrow <span class=JobTitle>executive</span> producers <span class=Person>Marc Guggenheim</span> and <span class=Person>Andrew Kreisberg</span> explain the <span class=Keyword>campaign</span> and how TV's hottest hooded vigilante factors in to the philanthropy this week.</p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: Where did the ""We Can Be Heroes"" concept come from, and why focus on the <span class=Keyword>hunger crisis</span> in <span class=Continent><span class=Country>Africa</span></span>?<span class=Person>Geoff Johns</span>: The world's greatest super <span class=Keyword>heroes</span> form the <span class=Organization>Justice League</span> - and the values these iconic <span class=Keyword>heroes</span> hold have always been aspirational and inspirational. That's why we love super heroes: They provide a powerful message of hope, optimism and action to people. And because of that, the <span class=Organization>Justice League</span> is helping us shine a light on the ""We Can Be Heroes"" <span class=Keyword>campaign</span> and asking people to go into action with them. The campaign's been rallying <span class=Keyword>fans</span> to join forces with the creators who bring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg to life across film, television, video games, animation and comic books.</p> <p>The focus of this phase of the <span class=Keyword>campaign</span> is on fighting the <span class=Keyword>hunger crisis</span> in the Horn of <span class=Continent><span class=Country>Africa</span></span>. Although 13 million men, women and children in the region were suffering the effects of the worst drought and famine seen by the region in over <span class=Quantity>60 years</span>, the <span class=FieldTerminology>humanitarian crisis</span> was under-reported and underfunded. <span class=Company><span class=City>DC</span> Entertainment</span> and <span class=Company>Warner Bros.</span> stepped up to become the first corporation to commit funds and support for the cause - something that makes me incredibly proud to be a part of this company.</p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: What are the funds raised by <span class=Company>WCBH</span> used for?Johns: All net proceeds from funds raised go to our three humanitarian-aid partners: Save the Children, the <span class=Organization>International Rescue Committee</span>, and <span class=Organization>Mercy Corps</span>. Each of these organizations has been working on the ground since the <span class=Keyword>hunger crisis</span> started.</p> <p>Page 2 of 3 - <span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: How can <span class=Keyword>fans</span> contribute? Is it as easy as just donating on <span class=Company>Indiegogo</span>?Johns: Yes. Our <span class=Keyword>fans</span> are already using <span class=Company>Indiegogo</span> to support a variety of projects, so we decided to meet them where they are. We also knew that we had the incentives or ""perks,"" as they're known on <span class=Company>Indiegogo</span>, that <span class=Keyword>fans</span> wanted, and that they could help encourage them to make multiple donations to support the campaign. We believed that things like signed DVDs, popular <span class=Keyword>comic books</span> with variant covers, <span class=Keyword>limited edition lithographs</span> and <span class=Keyword>unique fan experiences</span> with talent would help raise a lot of money to bring help and hope to the Horn of <span class=Continent><span class=Country>Africa</span></span>.</p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: Is it <span class=City>DC</span>'s plan to incorporate any of this philanthropy into the comics?Johns: We took popular <span class=Keyword>comic book titles</span> and created unique artwork like <span class=Keyword>variant covers</span> or lithographs specifically for ""We Can Be Heroes."" Our creators donated their time and signed, numbered and customized a variety of items, not just comic books, but also e-readers. They've also volunteered to hang out with <span class=Keyword>fans</span> at big events like <span class=City>San Diego</span> Comic-Con. We treated <span class=Keyword>fans</span> who supported the <span class=Keyword>campaign</span> like VIPs and gave them behind-the-scenes access. Anything we can do to return the favor of being part of ""We Can Be Heroes"" we are trying to do.</p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: How did you decide which <span class=Keyword>perks</span> would come with each member of the <span class=Organization>Justice League</span>?Johns: We want the <span class=Keyword>perks</span> to appeal not only to our core fans, but to other audiences that come to know our superheroes outside of comic books, like the <span class=Keyword>Arrow television series</span> on The CW, and through movies like Man of Steel and The <span class=Movie>Dark Knight</span>. So we worked with our friends within <span class=Company>Warner Bros.</span> to bring items like advance screenings and experiences like set visits to the mix to help bring in large donations for the campaign. For example, we just finished the Wonder Woman-themed week and those <span class=Keyword>perks</span> included a <span class=Person>Lynda Carter</span> experience and various signed <span class=Keyword>Wonder Woman</span> comics. I was hoping to win that one myself!</p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: This week's hero theme includes Green Arrow, and the perk a contributor could win is an advance screening party of an upcoming Arrow episode...do you know which one?Johns: The advance screening will definitely take place during the upcoming season, although the specific episode is TBD. But trust me, you do not want to miss this season. <span class=Hashtag>#BlackCanary</span></p> <p><span class=PrintMedia>TV Guide Magazine</span>: On the topic of Arrow, Season 2 starts soon and you have a flood of <span class=City>DC</span> characters coming in. What is the process of getting the OK from <span class=City>DC</span> to use characters like Black Canary and the Flash, who are both heading to the show?<span class=Person>Marc Guggenheim</span>: For the most part, it's a simple matter of calling or emailing our friends at <span class=City>DC</span>, like Geoff or [<span class=JobTitle>editor</span>] <span class=Person>Pornsak Pichetshote</span>. Depending on the profile or recognizability of the character, it's as simple as an email exchange. Some characters require a longer discussion. But <span class=City>DC</span> is always incredibly supportive and encouraging. And at the beginning of each season, they actually make suggestions as to which characters we might want to use. For example, they suggested Bronze Tiger, who appears in Episode 2 of the season.</p>","TV Guide - Today's News: Our Take - ""Heroes"" Worship: How DC Comics and Arrow Are Doing Good - News - Crookston Times - Crookston, MN - Crookston, MN",10/1/2013,"Geoff Johns, Marc Guggenheim, Andrew Kreisberg, Lynda Carter, Pornsak Pichetshote","DC, San Diego",

Blood <span class=Person>Jones</span>, 21, with <span class=Crime>assault</span> on a federal <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> with a dangerous or deadly weapon. Prosecutors asked Monday that they be held without bail pending trial. A judge will decide later.</p> <p>On Wednesday more charges were added against Crayton, <span class=Person>Jones</span> and another man, Dwayne Crayton, 24. They all face <span class=Keyword>multiple federal gun</span> and drug charges.</p> <p><span class=Person>Frederick Crayton</span> is from St. Louis; <span class=Person>Jones</span>' home community was not available.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>agent</span> with the <span class=Organization>Bureau of Alcohol</span>, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was pistol-whipped in the ensuing fight. <span class=Company><span class=Organization>ATF</span></span> spokeswoman <span class=Person>Trista Frederick</span> said Monday that the <span class=Keyword>agent</span> was doing fine. The <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s name was not revealed by the agency or in court records.</p> <p>Frederick could not explain how both guns malfunctioned at the same time. She did say that <span class=Company><span class=Organization>ATF</span></span> had neither provided the weapons nor tampered with them.</p> <p>Sometimes things just work out better for us than for them, she explained.</p> <p>Authorities said the guns were semi-automatic pistols, one a .40 caliber and one a 9 millimeter.</p> <p><span class=Person>Daniel E. Jackson</span>, a retired <span class=StateOrCounty>St. Louis County</span> police firearms examiner who now serves as a forensic <span class=JobTitle>consultant</span>, said Monday that while it was weird for both weapons to misfire repeatedly, it is not unusual for a street gun to fail.</p> <p>There are frequently, frequently bad guys running around out there with guns that dont work, Jackson said. Many guns are abused, and bought and sold cheaply on the street, he said. Im just amazed that most of them dont end up in a gunfight and find out the hard way.</p> <p>According to an affidavit filed in court by Special Agent <span class=Person>Russell G. Johnson</span>, one of the investigators, the undercover <span class=Keyword>agent</span> and the gunmen had had dealings before. The <span class=Keyword>agent</span> first met with them and another man to sell a gun to one of them, Johnson wrote. They met again April 15, and another man sold the <span class=Keyword>agent</span> and the informants <span class=Drug>crack cocaine</span>. The third meeting was Thursday, in the 3200 block of <span class=City>Henrietta Place</span>, just northeast of Interstate 44 and Grand Boulevard.</p> <p>The sellers pulled handguns, prompting a scuffle inside the car, officials said. The men pulled their triggers over and over but the pistols would not fire.The <span class=Keyword>agent</span> was struck with a gun, splitting (the agents) head open, the affidavit says. The fight then spilled out of the car. Witnesses saw the men point their guns and pull the triggers again, accompanied by more harmless clicking.</p> <p>The attackers ran off, only to be caught  with their guns  by other <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s nearby.</p> <p><span class=Country>U.S.</span> <span class=Person>Attorney Richard Callahan</span> said, Obviously, this is a situation that could have ended tragically. It just underscores the ... day-to-day danger that <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> faces and what you may encounter in these undercover investigations, he said. Speaking of <span class=Person>Jones</span> and <span class=Person>Frederick Crayton</span>, Callahan said, In their mind, they were going to rip them off.</p> <p>In court Monday, Assistant <span class=Country>U.S.</span> Attorney <span class=Person>Toni Decker</span> told <span class=Country>U.S.</span> <span class=Person>Magistrate Judge Thomas Mummert</span> the defendants were a danger to the community. If that gun had not misfired, we would probably be talking about a dead federal agent, she said. Mummert took the request under advisement.Decker said both men will probably be indicted on Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>Court records show this is the first time either man has faced a federal charge.</p> <p>In 1998, <span class=Person>Frederick Crayton</span> was convicted of <span class=Crime>burglary</span> and theft in <span class=StateOrCounty>St. Louis County</span>. In 2011, he was convicted of <span class=Keyword>misdemeanor property damage</span> in St. Louis.</p> <p><span class=Person>Frederick Crayton</span>s public defender, <span class=Person>Sean Vicente</span>, said his client had served minor sentences on both his prior cases. He said Crayton had worked at a diner until it closed.</p> <p>Vicente pointed out that <span class=Person>Jones</span> was the one accused of pistol-whipping the agent.</p> <p>Vicente noted, I dont know what to say about the faulty guns.</p> <p><span class=Person>Jones</span> <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span>, <span class=Person>Peter Cohen</span>, said his client was a self-employed tuckpointer whose only prior <span class=FieldTerminology>criminal case</span> was a misdemeanor <span class=Crime>assault</span> on a <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> at the age of 19. Cohen asked for <span class=Person>Jones</span> to be released on <span class=FieldTerminology>house arrest</span>.</p> <p>Neither lawyer commented outside the courtroom Monday.

The country also borders its longtime foe and U.S. ally <span class=Country>Israel</span>, making the fallout from <span class=Keyword>military action</span> unpredictable.</p> <p>Violence in <span class=Country>Syria</span> has already spilled over the past year to <span class=City>Lebanon</span>, <span class=Country>Turkey</span>, Iraq and the <span class=Country>Israel</span>i-occupied Golan Heights. Battle-hardened <span class=Organization>Hezbollah</span> fighters have joined the combat alongside Assad's forces.</p> <p>Speaking to <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span>s Sunday in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, U.S. Defense Secretary Hagel declined to say what action the U.S. might take. He said the administration is weighing many factors. These include an intelligence assessment of the attack in <span class=Country>Syria</span>, as well as what he called legal issues and the matter of international support for any military response.</p> <p>Meanwhile, U.S. naval units are moving closer to <span class=Country>Syria</span>. U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern <span class=GeographicFeature>Mediterranean Sea</span> but without immediate orders for any missile launch into <span class=Country>Syria</span>. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly.</p> <p><span class=JobTitle>President</span> <span class=Person>Obama</span> has emphasized that a quick intervention in the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n civil war was problematic, given the international considerations that should precede a military strike.</p> <p>After <span class=Person>Obama</span> met with his national security team Saturday, the <span class=Organization>White House</span> said U.S. intelligence officials are still trying to determine whether Assad's government unleashed the <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> attack earlier this week.</p> <p>The <span class=Organization>White House</span> statement said <span class=Person>Obama</span> received a detailed review of the range of options he has requested for the U.S. and the <span class=Keyword>international community</span> to respond if it is determined that Assad has engaged in deadly chemical warfare.</p> <p><span class=Person>Obama</span> spoke by telephone with British Prime Minister David Cameron about <span class=Country>Syria</span>, the <span class=Organization>White House</span> said.</p> <p>A statement from Cameron's office at No. 10 Downing St. said the prime minister and <span class=Person>Obama</span> are concerned by ""increasing signs"" that ""a significant <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> attack"" was carried out by the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n government against its people. <span class=Person>Obama</span> and Cameron ""reiterated that significant use of <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> would merit a serious response from the international community,"" according to the statement.</p> <p><span class=Country>Syria</span>'s <span class=Person>Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi</span> dismissed the possibility of an American attack, warning that such a move would risk triggering more violence in the region.</p> <p>""The basic repercussion would be a ball of fire that would burn not only <span class=Country>Syria</span> but the whole <span class=Region>Middle East</span>,"" al-Zoubi said in an interview with <span class=City>Lebanon</span>-based Al-Mayadeen TV. ""An attack on <span class=Country>Syria</span> would be no easy trip.""</p> <p>In Tehran, <span class=Country>Iran</span>'s Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Abbas Arakji, warned that an American military intervention in <span class=Country>Syria</span> will ""complicate matters.""</p> <p>""Sending warships will not solve the problems but will worsen the situation,"" Arakji said in comments carried by <span class=Country>Iran</span>'s Arabic-language TV Al-Alam. He added that any such U.S. move does not have international backing and that <span class=Country>Iran</span> ""rejects military solutions.""</p> <p>In <span class=Country>France</span>, <span class=Organization>Doctors Without Borders</span> said three hospitals it supports in the eastern <span class=City>Damascus</span> region reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms"" over less than three hours on Wednesday morning, when the attack in the eastern <span class=City>Ghouta</span> area took place.</p> <p>Of those, 355 died, the Paris-based group said.</p> <p>The Britain-based <span class=Country>Syria</span>n Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday that its estimated death toll from the <span class=Keyword>alleged chemical attack</span> had reached 322, including 54 children, 82 women and dozens of fighters. It said the dead included 16 people who have not been identified.</p> <p>The group said it raised its death toll from an earlier figure of 136, which had been calculated before its activists in the stricken areas met doctors, residents and saw medical reports. It said the dead ""fell in the massacre committed by the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n regime.""</p> <p>Death tolls have varied wildly over the alleged attack, with <span class=Country>Syria</span>n anti-government activists reporting between 322 and 1,300 killed.</p> <p>Al-Zoubi blamed the rebels for the chemical attacks in <span class=City>Ghouta</span>, saying that the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n government had proof of their responsibility but without giving details. ""The rockets were fired from their positions and fell on civilians. They are responsible,"" he said.</p> <p>With the pressure increasing, <span class=Country>Syria</span>'s <span class=FieldTerminology>state media</span> accused rebels in the contested district of <span class=City>Jobar</span> near <span class=City>Damascus</span> of using <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> against government troops Saturday.</p> <p>State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs, gas masks, vials of an unspecified medication, explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts Saturday.</p> <p>One barrel had ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on it. The TV report also showed medicines said to be produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are strong supporters of the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n rebels. The report could not be immediately verified.</p> <p>An army statement issued late Saturday said the discovery of the weapons ""is clear evidence that these gangs are using <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> against our people and soldiers with help from foreign sides.""</p> <p>The claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for Wednesday's alleged gas attack, which spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international <span class=Keyword>military action</span> if <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> were used.</p> <p>Just hours before the <span class=FieldTerminology>state media</span> reports, the <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> disarmament chief arrived in <span class=City>Damascus</span> to press Assad's regime to allow <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> experts to investigate the alleged Wednesday attack. The regime has denied allegations it was responsible, calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government.</p> <p>The U.S., Britain, <span class=Country>France</span> and Russia have urged the <span class=Keyword>Assad regime</span> and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the <span class=Organization>United Nations</span> and allow a team of experts already in <span class=Country>Syria</span> to look into the latest purported use of <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical agents</span>. The <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane, the high representative for disarmament affairs, to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesday's purported attack. She did not speak to <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span>s upon her arrival in <span class=City>Damascus</span> Saturday.</p> <p>The state news agency said several government troops who took part in the <span class=City>Jobar</span> offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed <span class=Keyword>terrorist groups</span> used <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span>."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation,"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops.</p> <p>""The <span class=Country>Syria</span>n Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason, the <span class=Keyword>terrorist groups</span> used <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> as their last card,"" state TV said. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists.""</p> <p>State TV also broadcast images of a <span class=Country>Syria</span>n army officer, wearing a surgical mask, telling <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span>s wearing similar masks that soldiers were subjected to poisonous attack in <span class=City>Jobar</span>. He spoke inside the depot where the alleged confiscated products were placed.</p> <p>""Our troops did not suffer body wounds,"" the officer said. ""I believe <span class=Keyword>terrorist groups</span> used special substances that are poisonous in an attempt to affect this advance.""</p> <p>Al-Mayadeen aired interviews with two soldiers hospitalized for possible <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> attack. The two appeared unharmed but were undergoing tests.</p> <p>""We were advancing and heard an explosion that was not very strong,"" a soldier said from his bed. ""Then there was a strange smell, my eyes and head ached and I struggled to breathe."" The other soldier also said he experienced trouble breathing after the explosion.</p> <p>Al-Mayadeen TV, which has a <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span> embedded with the troops in the area, said some 50 soldiers were rushed to <span class=City>Damascus</span> hospitals for treatment and that it was not yet known what type of gas the troops were subjected too.</p> <p>In <span class=Country>Turkey</span>, top <span class=Country>Syria</span>n rebel commander Salim Idris told <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span>s that opposition forces did not use <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> on Saturday and that ""the regime is lying.""</p> <p>For days, the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern <span class=City>Damascus</span>, arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack.</p> <p>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius dismissed the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n government's claims.</p> <p>""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in <span class=Country>Syria</span>, near <span class=City>Damascus</span>, and that <span class=Person>Bashar Assad</span>'s regime was behind it,"" Fabius told <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span>s during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate.</p> <p><span class=Country>France</span> has suggested that force could be used against <span class=Country>Syria</span> if Assad's regime was proven to have used chemical arms.</p> <p>The new talk of potential <span class=Keyword>military action</span> in in the country has made an independent investigation by <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired.</p> <p>The <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> experts already in <span class=Country>Syria</span> are tasked with investigating three <span class=Keyword>earlier purported chemical</span> attacks in the country: one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March, as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons.</p> <p>It took months of negotiations between the <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> and <span class=City>Damascus</span> before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into <span class=Country>Syria</span> to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites, however, and it is only charged with determining whether <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> were used, not who used them.</p> <p>Leaders of the main Western-backed <span class=Country>Syria</span>n opposition group on Saturday vowed retaliation for the alleged <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> attack.</p> <p>From Istanbul, the head of the <span class=Country>Syria</span>n National Coalition, Ahmad Al-Jarba, also criticized the lack of response to the attack by the <span class=Organization>United Nations</span> and the international community, saying the UN was discrediting itself.</p> <p>""It does not reach the ethical and legal response that <span class=Country>Syria</span>ns expect,"" he said.

But that charge was dismissed after <span class=FieldTerminology>District Judge</span> <span class=Person>James Reynolds</span> ruled that certain evidence, namely the windshield of Temples truck and a <span class=Keyword>blood sample</span> of the police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>, was mishandled, possibly hindering Temples defense.</p> <p>But other charges remained, namely a <span class=Keyword>felony count</span> of <span class=Crime>theft</span> related to silver coins.

He thought hed bought his own coins back.</p> <p>Miller had his son, <span class=Person>John</span>, review the stores surveillance footage, Broch said, and it showed that <span class=Keyword>Temple</span> had taken coins on multiple occasions from a box on the counter.

The <span class=Organization>Senate</span> Foreign Relations Committee, headed by <span class=StateOrCounty>New Jersey</span> Democrat <span class=Person>Bob Menendez</span>, will begin hearings on the matter Tuesday.</p> <p>In anticipation of the coming debate, <span class=Person>Obama</span> challenged lawmakers to consider what message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price.</p> <p>Members of <span class=Organization>Congress</span>, abruptly handed exactly the war powers many had demanded, grappled with whether to sign off on <span class=Person>Obama</span>s plan. Now with a stake in the nations global credibility, lawmakers were seeking more information about the possible consequences of striking a region without knowing what would happen next.</p> <p>The <span class=JobTitle>president</span> didnt say so, but his strategy carries enormous risks to his and the nations credibility, which the administration has argued forcefully is on the line in <span class=Country>Syria</span>. <span class=Person>Obama</span> long ago said the use of <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> was a <span class=FieldTerminology>red line</span> that <span class=Person>Assad</span> would not be allowed to cross with impunity.</p> <p>Last week, British Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating defeat when <span class=FieldTerminology>the House</span> of Commons refused to support his call for <span class=Keyword>military action</span> against <span class=Country>Syria</span>.</p> <p>Halfway around the world, <span class=Country>Syria</span>ns awoke Saturday to state television broadcasts of tanks, planes and other weapons of war, and troops training, all to a soundtrack of martial music. <span class=Person>Assad</span>s government blames rebels in the Aug. 21 attack and has threatened retaliation if attacked.</p> <p>Russian President <span class=Person>Vladimir Putin</span>, saying he was appealing to a Nobel Peace laureate rather than to a <span class=JobTitle>president</span>, urged <span class=Person>Obama</span> to reconsider. A group that monitors casualties in the long <span class=Country>Syria</span>n civil war challenged the <span class=Country>United States</span> to substantiate its claim that 1,429 died in a <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapons</span> attack, including more than 400 children.</p> <p>By accident or design, the new timetable gives time for <span class=Organization>U.N.</span> inspectors to receive lab results from the samples they took during four days in <span class=City>Damascus</span>, and to compile a final report. After leaving <span class=Country>Syria</span> overnight, the inspection team arrived in <span class=City>Rotterdam</span> a few hours before <span class=Person>Obama</span> spoke.</p> <p>The groups leader was expected to brief <span class=Keyword>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</span> today.</p> <p>Administration officials said <span class=Person>Obama</span> appeared set on ordering a strike until Friday evening. After a long walk in near 90-degree temperatures around the <span class=Facility><span class=Organization>White House</span></span> grounds with chief of staff <span class=Person>Denis McDonough</span>, the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> told his aide he had changed his mind.</p> <p>These officials said <span class=Person>Obama</span> initially drew resistance in a two-hour session attended by <span class=Person>Vice President Joe Biden</span>, Defense Secretary <span class=Person>Chuck Hagel</span>, Director of National Intelligence James Klapper, CIA Director John Brennan, <span class=Keyword>national security adviser</span> Susan Rice and <span class=Keyword>homeland security adviser</span> Lisa Monaco. They declined to say which of the participants had argued against <span class=Person>Obama</span>s proposal.</p> <p>Whatever <span class=Organization>Congress</span> ultimately decides, the developments marked a stunning turn.</p> <p>France is <span class=Person>Obama</span>s only major foreign ally for a strike, public polling shows support is lukewarm in the <span class=Country>United States</span> and dozens of lawmakers in both parties have signed a letter urging <span class=Person>Obama</span> not to act without their backing. Outside the gates of the <span class=Facility><span class=Organization>White House</span></span>, the chants of protesters could be heard as the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> stepped to a lectern set up in the Rose Garden.</p> <p>Had he gone ahead with a military strike, <span class=Person>Obama</span> would have become the first U.S. leader in three decades to attack a foreign nation without mustering <span class=Keyword>broad international support</span> or acting in direct defense of Americans. Not since 1983, when <span class=Person>President Ronald Reagan</span> ordered an invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada, has the U.S. been so alone in pursuing major lethal <span class=Keyword>military action</span> beyond a few attacks responding to strikes or threats against its citizens.</p> <p>Republicans generally expressed satisfaction at <span class=Person>Obama</span>s decision to seek congressional support and challenged him to make his case to the public and lawmakers alike that American power should be used to punish <span class=Person>Assad</span>.</p> <p>We are glad the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> is seeking authorization for any <span class=Keyword>military action</span> in <span class=Country>Syria</span> in response to serious, substantive questions being raised, Boehner and other <span class=Keyword>House Republican leaders</span> said in a joint statement.</p> <p>In consultation with the <span class=JobTitle>president</span>, we expect <span class=FieldTerminology>the House</span> to consider a measure the week of Sept. 9.

And although <span class=Keyword>Obama</span> supports the end of Assad's rule in <span class=Country>Syria</span>, the <span class=Facility><span class=Organization>White House</span></span> has made clear the objective of any <span class=Keyword>potential U.S. action</span> does not include regime change.</p> <p>""I think that there are some very important differences,"" <span class=Facility><span class=Organization>White House</span></span> spokesman <span class=Person>Josh Earnest</span> said about the comparisons. ""What we saw in that circumstance was an administration that was searching high and low to produce evidence to justify a military invasion, an <span class=Keyword>open-ended military invasion</span> of another country, with the final goal being regime change.""</p> <p>Central to Obama's criticism of <span class=Person>Bush</span>'s push for war in <span class=Country>Iraq</span> was that <span class=Person>Saddam Hussein</span> posed ""no imminent and direct threat to the <span class=Country>United States</span> or to his neighbors.""</p> <p>In arguing for action against the Assad regime, <span class=Keyword>Obama</span> and his aides have made the case that failure to punish Assad for something as out-of-step with <span class=Keyword>international norms</span> as a large-scale chemical attack would undermine U.S. credibility and embolden rogue states, such as  <span class=Country>North Korea</span> and <span class=Country>Iran</span>, in their own calculations.</p> <p>Obama tapped <span class=FieldTerminology>Secretary of State</span> <span class=Person>John Kerry</span> to announce the release of the <span class=Keyword>U.S. intelligence</span> assessment of <span class=Country>Syria</span>'s <span class=FieldTerminology>chemical weapon</span> use. Kerry offered an impassioned performance that in some ways echoed then-secretary of State <span class=Person>Colin Powell</span>'s presentation to the <span class=Organization>United Nations</span> that <span class=Keyword>U.S. intelligence</span> officials had assessed with ""high confidence"" that <span class=Country>Iraq</span> possessed <span class=FieldTerminology>weapons of mass destruction</span>, a claim that proved to be false.</p> <p>Like Powell, Kerry used the term ""high confidence"" to describe the <span class=Keyword>U.S. intelligence</span> on <span class=Country>Syria</span>.</p> <p>Kerry has his own scars from the <span class=Country>Iraq</span> War. As a <span class=JobTitle>senator</span>, Kerry voted in favor of going to war in <span class=Country>Iraq</span> before souring on the <span class=Person>Bush</span> administration's handling of the conflict. In Kerry's unsuccessful run for the <span class=Facility><span class=Organization>White House</span></span> in 2004, the <span class=Person>Bush</span> campaign effectively branded Kerry as flip-flopping on the issue, even as the American public's support for fighting in <span class=Country>Iraq</span> began to ebb.</p> <p>In making his case to the public that military action was necessary, he sounded cognizant of the ghosts of <span class=Country>Iraq</span>.</p> <p>""Now, we know that after a decade of conflict, the American people are tired of war,"" Kerry said.

His lawyers were in court Tuesday for a first appearance on the charge. <span class=City>Kerrick</span>, 27, did not attend.

Chestnut said the tape shows that <span class=City>Kerrick</span> fired four shots, then paused. Moments later, the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> fired six more rounds and paused again before firing the last two shots.</p> <p>""This is clearly a criminal shooting,"" he told the <span class=Company>Associated Press</span>.</p> <p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg <span class=Keyword>police</span> refused the AP's request to release the tape, saying it was part of an ongoing criminal investigation.</p> <p><span class=City>Kerrick</span> joined the <span class=Keyword>police</span> force in April 2011 after working as an animal control <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>. He grew up in nearby <span class=StateOrCounty>Cabarrus County</span>.</p> <p><span class=City>Kerrick</span> and two other <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s responding to the breaking and entering call found <span class=Keyword>Ferrell</span> on a road that only leads to the neighborhood's pool. <span class=Keyword>Ferrell</span> ran toward the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s, who tried to stop him with a Taser. Police said he continued to run toward them and <span class=City>Kerrick</span> fired 12 shots, hitting <span class=Keyword>Ferrell</span> with all but two. <span class=Keyword>Ferrell</span> died at the scene.</p> <p>Chestnut and representatives of the <span class=Organization>NAACP</span> have questioned whether race played a role in the shooting. <span class=Keyword>Ferrell</span> is black, while <span class=City>Kerrick</span> is white. Though there was praise for <span class=Keyword>police</span> for quickly filing charges, some said the shooting didn't surprise them, considering portrayals of black men in popular culture and previous instances of racially inflected violence</p> <p>On the 911 tape released by the city, the woman tells a <span class=Keyword>dispatcher</span> that she thought her husband had returned home around 2:30 a.m. But when she opened the door, a man tried to get in.</p> <p>Sobbing and trying to catch her breath, the woman asked the dispatcher: ""Where are the cops?""</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>dispatcher</span> tried to calm her down, repeating over and over that they were on the way.</p> <p>He also asked her to describe the man. She told him he was black, about <span class=Quantity>210 pounds</span> and wearing a green shirt.</p> <p>At one point, the woman told the <span class=Keyword>dispatcher</span> about her baby. ""He's in his bed. I don't know what to do. I can't believe I opened the door...Please don't let him get my baby,"" she cried.</p> <p>When <span class=Keyword>police</span> arrived at the scene, she peeked out her window. And when the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s began looking for a man, the <span class=Keyword>dispatcher</span> assured the woman they weren't leaving.</p> <p>On Monday, Ferrell's family said in their first public remarks in the case that the former <span class=Organization>Florida A&M University</span> <span class=Sport>football</span> player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs.

[For instance,] people looking for a job will send a rsum and <span class=Keyword>cover letter</span> in a <span class=Keyword>handwritten envelope</span> with the person's name misspelled. Yet, they explain how proficient they are with <span class=Company>MS Office</span> but the <span class=Keyword>handwritten envelope</span> indicates they don't know how to print a <span class=Keyword>standard envelope</span> using MS Word.""</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>reader</span> went on. ""The <span class=Keyword>job description</span> indicates the <span class=Keyword>right candidate</span> must be detail-oriented, but when the envelope has misspellings, it is the first indication that they are not."" Also, she continued, ""Candidates will reply to emails using very text-like language: no capitalization, no punctuation, and slang. Serious candidates need to eliminate the word 'got' from their letters. Use a thesaurus to find a substitute.""</p> <p>And her conclusion was, ""If candidates are asking why they're not get- ting interviews, perhaps it's time to step back and take a <span class=Keyword>good look</span> at the first <span class=Keyword>impression</span> they're sending long before any <span class=Keyword>potential interview</span> is possible."" The email was signed with her name, followed by her title: <span class=JobTitle>Performance Consultant</span>.</p> <p>Well now, I couldn't agree more - and I'm sure the same will hold true with anyone reading these words, but I must tell you two interesting things about this: one now and one at the end of this column.</p> <p>First, her email came to me before that column appeared: a happy coincidence. I'm glad to know that this matters to someone other than me, and it does bring up a point I make both in my rsum workshops and in my <span class=JobTitle>private practice</span>.</p> <p>That point is simple: your rsum - like any other written communication device, such as cover letters, <span class=Company>LinkedIn</span> profiles, and so on - is really your first impression. It is the way the world sees you before it meets you. Thus, your entry into the room is actually your second impression. This, of course, does not minimize the impact you have when you walk in, but it does help us focus on the importance of powerful and clean written communication.</p> <p>Our <span class=Keyword>reader</span> was focusing on detail-oriented issues, spelling and so forth, and there's no way to overemphasize it. Never mind for now the high-level matters of good writing, expressing key ideas, selecting your words wisely and crafting them into well-sculptured phrases, and being clear, concise and compelling; you've heard that from me (and read it here) many times.</p> <p>The fact remains, though, that these <span class=Keyword>seemingly little things</span> are bigger than they appear, kind of like those images in your side-view mirrors. The difference is that, on your mirror, they at least have the consideration to tell you. In this case, you're on your own to figure it out.</p> <p>It is widely agreed that the No. 1 <span class=Keyword>pet peeve</span> of recruiters and hiring managers is still the issue of <span class=Keyword>misspellings</span> and <span class=Keyword>typographical errors</span> on your letter and rsum. We can include, thanks to this reader, things like lack of capital letters, unnecessary text-like abbreviations, no punctuation, and then - further - more than one font, improper spacing (which might suggest hasty cut-and-paste jobs), and a host of other annoying little (but blatant) errors.</p> <p>Yes, indeed, this is your first impression. And to make it a more weighty issue than it appears on the surface, remember that a lot of your written communications are out there in cyberspace - and will be there forever and for an awful lot of people to see for an awfully long time. If your letter and rsum were sent only in <span class=FieldTerminology>hard copy</span> in a <span class=Keyword>sealed envelope</span> to one person only, then visibility of your mistakes would be limited, maybe even undetected by a less-than-critical reader. The problem is, though, that's not usually the case. When you're out there, you're out there - in a fish bowl.</p> <p>So I think this point is (a) self-evident and (b) big enough to pay closer attention to than we normally and casually do. My reason for making this rather obvious statement brings us to - and was prompted by - the second interesting thing about this story (which I promised above to tell you here).</p> <p>In the email from our performance consultant, who was considerate enough to take the time to write and whose point is well taken - especially about the <span class=Keyword>misspellings</span> - there were two <span class=Keyword>misspellings</span> and one typographical error!</p> <p>I thanked her for her valuable input and politely pointed out her transgressions, for which she sent me an appreciative email with a comment that haste always carries risk.</p> <p>Exactly the point.</p> <p>Career Coach <span class=Person>Eli Amdur</span> conducts workshops and one-on-one coaching in <span class=FieldTerminology>Job Search</span>, Career Planning, Rsums and Interviewing.

It's not lip-service tough. Not politically-measured tough. This law is tough in a way that confirms the bravery of the <span class=Keyword>state legislators</span> who voted for it and <span class=Person>Gov. Martin O'Malley</span> who signed it.</p> <p>The law should be a blueprint for the nation. Here's what it says:</p> <p>If you want to buy a handgun, you must be fingerprinted, take a <span class=Keyword>safety test</span> and get a <span class=Quantity>$50</span> license. Even then, you may only purchase one such gun every <span class=Quantity>30 days</span>.</p> <p>If you want to buy an AK-47, AR-15 or any of 45 other semi-automatics and copycats, forget it. You can't.</p> <p>You also can't buy a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, and you can't own the type of ""cop-killer"" bullets that have led to the deaths of at least 35 officers in the last decade.</p> <p>There's a lot more: a uniform procedure by which dealers and <span class=Keyword>state police</span> register firearms; a ban on those with criminal records or <span class=Keyword>mental health problems</span> from owning guns and all types of ammunition, and a <span class=Keyword>new requirement</span> for <span class=Keyword>state police</span> to <span class=FieldTerminology>shut down</span> rogue dealers whose guns show up in a <span class=Keyword>disproportionate number</span> of crimes.</p> <p>It's tough. You know that because the <span class=Organization>NRA</span> and a lot of its supporters here hate it.</p> <p>And you know it has teeth because for the last month or so there's been a run on handguns and automatic weapons at shops like <span class=Company>Realco Guns</span> here in District Heights. Statewide, <span class=Keyword>gun sales</span> in September have been about seven times the levels of a year ago.</p> <p>That's an <span class=Keyword>unfortunate byproduct</span> of the new law.</p> <p>Even more unfortunate is that until other states pass similar laws, and until the federal government deals more aggressively with Internet guns sales, <span class=StateOrCounty>Maryland</span>'s efforts will only be partially effective.</p> <p>""Our tears are not enough,"" <span class=Person>President Obama</span> declared after 12 people were shot by a gunman at the <span class=Organization>DC Navy Yard</span>. But the <span class=JobTitle>president</span>'s own <span class=Keyword>gun legislation</span> has been blocked in <span class=Organization>Congress</span> and has no chance in this session.</p> <p>Also troubling is that firearms manufacturers remain exempted from the type of product-liability laws that govern so many other products. Indeed, since 2005 <span class=FieldTerminology>federal law</span> has moved in the opposite direction by offering specific protection to <span class=Keyword>gun makers</span> in lawsuits and other claims.</p> <p>Violent crime here in <span class=StateOrCounty>Maryland</span> has already reached an historic low according to state figures. But Gov. O'Malley notes, ""Just one life lost to senseless violence is one too many."" He correctly labeled the <span class=Keyword>new law</span> ""a common sense approach"" to dealing with the nation's <span class=Keyword>gun nightmare</span> that has extended from <span class=City>Aurora</span>, to <span class=City>Newtown</span>, to the <span class=Organization>Washington Navy Yard</span> -- with many <span class=Keyword>horrifying stops</span> between.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Colorado</span>'s lawmakers have also addressed the <span class=Keyword>gun plague</span> bravely, with new laws that expand the state's background-check system to include private sales; keep guns out of the hands of criminals; <span class=Keyword>limit ammunition magazines</span> to 15 rounds, and <span class=Keyword>prohibit domestic abusers</span> from buying or keeping guns.</p> <p>Which state's lawmakers will be the next to show enough gumption to implement similar laws?</p> <p>Here in <span class=StateOrCounty>Maryland</span>, the man behind the counter at <span class=Company>Realco Guns</span> was struggling to serve a crowd of customers on a weekday morning, just a few days before the <span class=Keyword>new law</span> was to take effect.</p> <p>""We don't give out information, we don't do interviews, and we don't answer questions,"" he said.</p> <p>Then, taking a quick step back, he added, ""Unless you want to buy a gun.""</p> <p><span class=Person>Peter Funt</span>'s latest book, ""Cautiously Optimistic,"" is available at Amazon.com and CandidCamera.com.</p>",Maryland bravely passes gun control,,"Gov.

Photo by <span class=Person>Annie Chesnut</span> The <span class=Person>Eleanor <span class=Person>Roosevelt</span></span> <span class=Organization>Leadership Center</span> described <span class=Person>Gloria Steinem</span> as, Writer, lecturer, editor, and feminist activist. <span class=JobTitle>Co-founder</span> <span class=Person>Ms. Magazine</span>. Founding <span class=JobTitle>president</span> of <span class=Organization>Ms. Foundation for Women</span>, a national multi-racial, multi-issue fund that supports grassroots projects to empower women and girls. <span class=JobTitle>Founder</span> of its Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the first national day devoted to girls. Extraordinary <span class=FieldTerminology>social justice</span> activist; Change agent; Galvanizer. But especially significant to us is the fact that Steinem is also an accomplished journalist and author.</p> <p>Now 79, shes instantly recognizable with her trademark hair and glasses. In person, shes warm and engaged, a thoughtful conversationalist and a careful listener. Steinem was genuinely pleased to be selected as a <span class=Person>Roosevelt</span> medal winner, but made it clear that her own legacy is in no way completetheres plenty more work to be done.</p> <p>This native of <span class=City>Toledo</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Ohio</span> was raised by a mother who revered <span class=Person>Eleanor <span class=Person>Roosevelt</span></span>, and Steinem recalls vividly how that informed her own perception of womens capabilities.</p> <p>Steinem is a <span class=Organization>Phi Beta Kappa</span> graduate of <span class=Person>Smith</span> College, in <span class=City>Northampton</span>, Mass. <span class=Person>Julia Child</span>, Sylvia Plath, Molly Ivins, Betty Friedan, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush were all <span class=Person>Smith</span>ies, as is my own daughter.

She added that people have different kinds of lives and some may not need that centrality, but that its very important to have it as a choice.</p> <p>As for the future of women in American politics? What we make it. Only what we make it. Its never been about biology; its always been about consciousness. There will always be some men who are better feminists than some women, but the best combination is when it comes together, when you know what its like to walk around as a female for 30 or 40 years in this culture.</p> <p>As for the role of feminism in todays world, Steinem said, Weve barely begun. Asked what a modern-day feminist should be working on, she added, There are no shoulds. Its important, she said, that we support each other in our diversity, not that we dictate one goal. Sometimes, she noted, priorities are imposed from the outside, as can happen at election time, but, We are strongest when each of us is doing what we love, what we care about so much that we would do it even if we didnt get paid to do it. Our jobs are as much to listen as to talk.</p> <p>Of <span class=Person>Eleanor <span class=Person>Roosevelt</span></span>, Steinem said, She was a big part of my childhood. She was the single thing that connected my mother to the government. And, Steinem added, Because she stayed true to herself, her message about human rights is as fresh and inspiring now as it was when she was alive</p> <p>In a casualty of the ongoing federal government shutdown, the event was moved to from the Val-Kill estate in Hyde Park to the <span class=Keyword>lavishly appointed Astor</span> Courts, in Rhinebeck.</p> <p><span class=Person>Kathleen Durham</span>, who is the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> of the <span class=Person>Eleanor <span class=Person>Roosevelt</span></span> <span class=Organization>Leadership Center</span>, welcomed all of the honorees and guests for a meet-and-greet reception followed by a festive luncheon at which the medals were conferred.</p> <p>Steinem has traveled extensively and written seriously about the cultures in which women are key participants.</p> <p>What we are all demonstrating in different ways is that people are people and that gender is an artificial invention. What we need to understand more is that  the masculine role got invented in order to control reproduction [with the feminine role being subordinate to that] What inspires me are the original cultures, some on this continent, who didnt have gender [roles]Right where were sitting there was a nation of the <span class=Organization>Iroquois Confederacy</span> in which women werepart of every decision making structure.</p> <p>Our final question for Steinem was.

www.marionstar.com/usatoday/article/2928321,Marion,OH,"<p><span class=City>BAGHDAD</span> (AP) - A <span class=Keyword>suicide bomber</span> blew himself up among a crowd of <span class=Keyword>Shiite pilgrims</span> passing through a <span class=Keyword>mainly Sunni neighborhood</span> in Baghdad and another detonated his explosives inside a cafe north of the capital, the deadliest of several attacks across <span class=Country>Iraq</span> on Saturday that killed at least 66 people.</p> <p>The killings, which also included attacks on journalists and anti-extremist Sunni fighters, are part of the deadliest surge in violence to hit <span class=Country>Iraq</span> in five years. The accelerating bloodshed is raising fears that the country is falling back into the spiral of violence that brought it to the edge of <span class=FieldTerminology>civil war</span> in the years after the 2003 <span class=Country>U.S.</span>-led invasion.</p> <p>The extent of the carnage from the evening attack on the pilgrims became clearer as midnight approached, when officials sharply revised the death toll upward to at least 42. Another 80 were reported injured.</p> <p>The bomber detonated his explosives at a checkpoint in the northern neighborhood of <span class=City><span class=Person>Azamiyah</span></span> as the pilgrims en route to a <span class=Keyword>prominent Shiite shrine</span> in the nearby neighborhood of <span class=City>Kazimiyah</span>, according to police officials. At least four policemen manning the checkpoint were among the dead, the officials said.</p> <p><span class=City><span class=Person>Azamiyah</span></span> and the <span class=Keyword>Shiite district</span> of <span class=City>Kazimiyah</span> sit on opposite sides of the <span class=GeographicFeature>Tigris River</span> that snakes through the <span class=Country>Iraq</span>i capital. Their proximity made them a key flashpoint for the <span class=Keyword>widespread sectarian conflict</span> that gripped <span class=Country>Iraq</span> after <span class=Person>Saddam Hussein</span>'s ouster and peaked in 2006 and 2007. Authorities closed the bridge between the neighborhoods after hundreds of <span class=Keyword>Shiite pilgrims</span> died in a 2005 stampede sparked by fears of a suicide bomber, and reopened it in 2008.</p> <p>Around the same time, another <span class=Keyword>suicide bomber</span> blew himself up in a cafe in the town of <span class=City>Balad</span>, a <span class=Keyword>largely Shiite town</span> surrounded by <span class=Keyword>Sunni communities</span> about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Baghdad. <span class=City>Balad</span> <span class=Person>Mayor Malik Lefta</span> said at least 13 people were killed and 22 were wounded in that attack.</p> <p>He said the cafe was the same one hit by a deadly <span class=FieldTerminology>suicide bombing</span> in August.</p> <p>A hidden bomb also exploded inside a cafe in the religiously <span class=Keyword>mixed Baghdad neighborhood</span> of Baiyaa, killing three people and wounding 13, police said.</p> <p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the day's violence. <span class=Organization>Al-Qaida</span>'s <span class=Country>Iraq</span> arm often deploys <span class=FieldTerminology>suicide bombers</span> and targets <span class=Keyword>Shiite civilians</span> in an effort to undermine confidence in the Shiite-led government.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, gunmen shot dead a <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span> and a cameraman for the privately owned <span class=Keyword>al-Sharqiya TV channel</span> while they were working on a report in the northern city of <span class=City>Mosul</span>, according to police. The city is a former <span class=Keyword>Sunni insurgent stronghold</span> that has been one of the hardest areas of <span class=Country>Iraq</span> to tame.</p> <p>Al-Sharqiya identified the correspondent as <span class=Person>Mohammed Karim al-Badrani</span> and the cameraman as <span class=Person>Mohammed Ghanem</span>. It was not immediately clear why they were targeted.</p> <p>Al-Sharqiya is one of several independent channels that took to the airwaves following the 2003 ouster of former dictator <span class=Person>Saddam Hussein</span>. It has drawn the ire of the current <span class=Keyword>Shiite-led government</span> with <span class=Keyword>critical reports highlighting</span> corruption, poor services and other shortcomings. Authorities suspended its operating license along with those of eight other <span class=Country>Iraq</span>i channels and pan-Arab broadcaster <span class=TelevisionStation>Al-Jazeera</span> in April after accusing them of inflaming sectarian tensions.</p> <p>The channel's news <span class=JobTitle>director</span>, <span class=Person>Ali Wajih</span>, said in a phone interview that he had not received any information from <span class=City>Mosul</span> police, and he hoped the killings would be investigated.</p> <p>""This is not new for al-Sharqiya. This is usual for <span class=Country>Iraq</span>, that they kill journalists,"" he said, adding that 16 of the channel's employees have been killed since 2003. Among them are four who were kidnapped and killed in 2008 while on assignment in <span class=City>Mosul</span>.</p> <p><span class=Country>Iraq</span> was the deadliest country in the world for journalists between 2003 and 2008. Although members of the media continue to face intimidation, the <span class=Organization>New York-based Committee</span> to Protect Journalists has not reported a <span class=Crime>murder</span> of a journalist in the country since September 2011.</p> <p>At least six members of Sunni militias opposed to al-Qaida were also killed Saturday. The militiamen were members of the <span class=City>Sahwa</span>, which joined <span class=Country>U.S.</span> troops in the fight against al-Qaida at the height of <span class=Country>Iraq</span> war.

www.neagle.com/article/20130919/NEWS/309199912,Hawley,PA,"<p>Page 2 of 8 - What was it about <span class=Person>Dexter Morgan</span> that made him a likable and relatable character?  <span class=Person>Hall</span>: Certainly the fact that he kills the kinds of victims he kills and that he doesn't just off <span class=Keyword>people</span> who look at him funny gives <span class=Keyword>people</span> permission to identify with him. He was compelling because he made the claim that he was without the capacity for <span class=Keyword>human emotion</span> and we were maybe meant to be suspicious of that. Even we thought he didn't have the full capacity, in spite of anything, he did seem to have the appetite; an <span class=Keyword>appetite</span> that was exploited by the <span class=Keyword>Ice Truck killer</span> (<span class=Person>Christian Camargo</span>). Over the course of the show, that <span class=Keyword>appetite</span> has been exploited again and again in different, deeper and dicier ways.</p> <p>What depths did you have to go to in order to play a serial killer? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: I'm someone who certainly is not opposed to doing a certain amount of research and certainly I'm interested in drawing in my own experience up to a point. But I do think that some of the appeal with <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> is that it inevitably requires an <span class=Keyword>imaginative leap</span> unless I was willing to go out and actually off <span class=Keyword>people</span> and see what that felt like. I wasn't going to be able to know exactly what it was like to live his specific life. Frankly, if I did that it wouldn't really help much because it's not really my inclination. I have my compulsions, but it's definitely not that.</p> <p>How much did you relate to your character? <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: From the beginning, I wouldn't say we were the same shape, really. We couldn't have been mistaken for each other, but I was as green as she was. When you're doing television, there's not a set date for it to end or a set story so you know exactly where you're taking it. I had to lend her pieces of me to survive and keep it honest in a way. I had to use my imagination to make her very separate and far from me as well. So it just became about isolating between one side or the other. Either I was working at something for myself or I was taking a vacation from myself and really luxuriating in this fictitious person.</p> <p>Talk about the evolution of <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> and <span class=Person>Deb</span>ra.  <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: When I look back on it, I'm aware that it wasn't easy. It wasn't a job where I was ever at rest. Creatively, I'm really grateful to that. But it wasn't like she made a pivot from <span class=Keyword>season</span> to season. It was like she was spinning in <span class=Quantity>360-degree</span> circles again and again and she just couldn't find a place to stop. There was a part of me, just as the actor, that envied the voiceover. I wish <span class=Person>Deb</span> had one from time to time because I had no idea what to make of it. With the clock running and someone is going to say, ""Action"" momentarily, you have to just pull the trigger and make a decision. Often times that's what I was doing. I got to a place where I started to work with what really was in the room with me and often times that was fear and confusion and muscle. And often times I feel like those are also adjectives that can be used to describe <span class=Person>Deb</span>ra. There was something, by the end of it, something that was pure in the beginning, unfortunately became spoiled. I feel like I knew four seasons in that there was never going to be a happy ending for <span class=Person>Deb</span>. <span class=Person>Hall</span>: Over the course of the show, it's been about navigating the twists and turns in ways in which he has evolved or devolved. Playing the role has ultimately required a great deal of flexibility in terms of my initial conceptions and how those have been challenged and how they've had to morph over the life of the show.</p> <p>Page 3 of 8 - Was there a line you personally wouldn't cross on the series? <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: When the conversation about <span class=Person>Deb</span>ra having feelings for her brother came up, there was talk about a <span class=Keyword>scene</span> where - you know the <span class=Keyword>scene</span> where they're having Chinese food and they kiss? That was originally going to be a love scene, and I absolutely was not going to do that, so that's the first thing that comes to mind. I renegotiated it down to a very swift kiss. <span class=Person>Hall</span>: For me, any kind of line drawing was more about how we did things. Sometimes we were missing something in terms of the connective tissue that I felt we needed to feel like we were maintaining some sense, or my own sense, of the character's truth. I always had as much of an <span class=Keyword>appetite</span> as anyone for him to go far and farther, to completely go unhinged and fly off the handle. But because we didn't want to just blow the things up or crash and burn, we had to have him maintain some <span class=Keyword>sense</span> of control over his world and himself.</p> <p>What has been your favorite moment on the series? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: There have been so many, but I always come back to <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> discovering his origin story and doing that face plant into the room full of blood in the 10th episode of the first season. There was something about playing that <span class=Keyword>scene</span> and setting up all the cameras, we could only do it once because we were making such a mess.  <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: There were a lot of scenes that I was afraid to play, like when <span class=Person>Lundy</span> (<span class=Person>Keith Carradine</span>) died in the parking lot scene, I was a mess. I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to play that scene. I didn't want to shoot <span class=Person>LaGuerta</span> (<span class=Person>Lauren Velez</span>). It was traumatic in a weird way. You're so far into the series, it becomes real to a certain extent. It hurt me personally to play those scenes. But they are, in turn, my favorites because with great risk comes rewards. They taught me so much about how important it is to work with good people.</p> <p>One of the most revealing scenes that I've played was with <span class=Person>Quinn</span> (<span class=Person>Desmond Harrington</span>) in the finale. We have a <span class=Keyword>scene</span> in the ambulance and it was the <span class=Keyword>scene</span> that left him for the series. As soon as we cut on it and it was over, it was as if the love that existed between these two characters was hovering between us and they could both see it, and it broke my heart. Because I don't know that I'll ever work with another actor that will go there the <span class=Keyword>way</span> that Desmond did.  Basically what I'm saying is I'm spoiled rotten. I guess every moment was my favorite because I feel like there were so many other actors that just didn't feel like getting out of bed to go to that audition that day and then I had a good day. The course of my life and this show could be very different.</p> <p>Who has been your favorite villain? <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: <span class=Person>John Lithgow</span>, because he was a teddy bear to be around and a grizzly to work with.  <span class=Person>Hall</span>: <span class=Person>Trinity</span> (Lithgow), because he is the most complex, formidable and the most like <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> in terms of the <span class=Keyword>way</span> he tried to live his life. And he's my favorite dramatically because the real marker is before and after <span class=Person>Trinity</span> kills <span class=Person>Rita</span> (<span class=Person>Julie Benz</span>). Before that point, <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> could really operate under the reasonable assumption that he was not affecting those closest to him with what he was doing. Ever since, he's been scrambling to protect <span class=Keyword>people</span> from who he is.</p> <p>What was your favorite <span class=Person>Deb</span> curse word? <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: It's kind of strange that you're asking me this question now because I'm sort of repulsed by all of it. At the gym this morning, <span class=Person>Robin Thicke</span>'s song came on and someone mentioned it's possibly about date <span class=Crime>rape</span> or something. It's called ""Blurred Lines"" and they repeat, ""You know you want it,"" again and again. That's so much of what's out there right now on the radio and television. It's just crude and disgusting and it infuriates me, to be honest. I have to justify it with <span class=Person>Deb</span> because it's her go-to tool and it was effective and it made <span class=Keyword>people</span> pay attention to her. It was a crutch really. It wasn't cheap, I guess is what I'm saying. So to go back and say ""I loved it when she said this F-bomb or this <span class=Keyword>weird compound blending</span> of two bad words"" makes it cheap and I would like to leave it thinking that it wasn't.</p> <p>Page 5 of 8 - What was the turning point of the series? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: [The <span class=Keyword>Ice Truck killer</span> and <span class=Person>Rita</span>'s death] are fundamental early on. His discovery of his nature of his origins story, and that he's not alone, and that he has this brother, and that he has an <span class=Keyword>appetite</span> for a connection with him, and this may be trumped by his <span class=Keyword>sense</span> of connection with is sister: Those are all things when we meet <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> at the beginning of the <span class=Keyword>season</span> he doesn't anticipate and isn't aware he has the capability to experience or appreciate.</p> <p>Certainly when <span class=Person>Rita</span> is killed - someone else in Dexter's world, a world that is being more and more characterized by seemingly legitimate connection, this is his wife with whom he has a child - someone else is implicated and whatever compartmentalization he had successfully cultivated starts to fall apart and those lines start to blur or disappear. Dexter's reeling from that throughout the rest of the series. Every <span class=Keyword>season</span> and every major relationship that <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> has further exploits that there's a real <span class=Keyword>appetite</span> for connection and revelation. And in a way, the more he moves towards the light, the more the darkness is all the darker in stark relief. The more he becomes like a human, the darker it is to really consider the fact that he continues to kill.</p> <p>What is your reaction when fans say that Season 4 was the height of the series? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: I mean I get it. Like I said, he's just been reeling ever since <span class=Person>Trinity</span> got the best of him. He killed <span class=Person>Trinity</span>, so I guess he got the best of <span class=Person>Trinity</span> in a way, but he killed him with a lack of knowledge of what <span class=Person>Trinity</span> had really done. As the show initially presented some big adversary, <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> would one <span class=Keyword>way</span> or another come to know and vanquish, that's the pinnacle of that model. The <span class=Person>Trinity</span> killing was the most prolific, formidable foe that <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> ever faced.  <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: What's funny is that maybe ignorance truly is bliss, because I really did somehow manage to be ignorant to the success of the show. Even when <span class=Keyword>people</span> say something to me now, I'm sort of skeptical, like, ""Who told you about the show?"" I can't imagine that <span class=Keyword>people</span> are actually watching it. So, was that the height of it? I don't know. I don't really give a lot of credit to <span class=Keyword>people</span> who make comments on the internet. I avoid it really. That's their business. If <span class=Keyword>people</span> think that was the height, then they're right because whatever the fans say goes.</p> <p>How do you feel about the final <span class=Keyword>season</span> going back to the beginning and looking at how the code was created? <span class=Person>Hall</span>:  I was never very interested in the show staying in the same place. <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> could have gone more strict, hard and fast adherent to the code and we could have followed a similar formula and had a sort of ""Who's <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> going to kill this week?"" be the primary question we were preoccupied with. But there was a desire to directly challenge the audience's affection for the character. <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> is someone who had the code instilled in him by a father (<span class=Person>James Remar</span>) who arguably was a great dad, outside-of-the-box thinker, and on the other hand, abusive. <span class=Keyword>Dexter</span> has an impulse to rebel and his roles are not conventional roles. They're roles imposed by a self-appointed deity in the form of his father and, he comes to discover in the final season, in his spiritual mother (<span class=Person>Charlotte Rampling</span>). If he's going to rebel, he's going to rebel against the code and play faster and looser with his roles. He always, in the end, comes back to an appreciation for how it's protected him and kept him safe. But we don't always learn our lessons on time. Sometimes we learn them too late. <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: Most years I was given the bare bones before we shot the first episode of each season. This year, I was told about what the first three episodes would look like. And the <span class=Keyword>way</span> that it was presented to me is that the rest is all up in the air. The rest was Dexter's business. So I didn't know and I didn't have Showtime because of the Time Warner thing. I turned it off. So I'm lost. I remember it as someone who lived it and not someone who studied it. I've never been confused about a season, but I'm confused about the end, and I think that might be a big sign for it being successful if that makes any sense.</p> <p>What are you hoping the audience will take away from the series? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: A <span class=Keyword>sense</span> that they've taken a ride that has been consistently compelling and cohesive and has started in one place and ended somewhere else. Different <span class=Keyword>people</span> like the show for different reasons. I just hope it's something that continually resulted in <span class=Keyword>people</span> leaning forward. I think it's done that.  <span class=Person>Carpenter</span>: It's a funny thing because it was the most amazing show. I feel like we are all huffing and puffing at the finish line. I feel like we all survived a marathon together. It's a strange thing to say to the audience, ""We ran for you. I hope you know we worked so hard for you."" So I hope they know that, although there may have been highs or lows throughout all eight seasons, which is something to be expected for something that goes that long, I hope they know it was sincere. I hope they know it was emotionally expensive for all of us. In a weird way, this could be totally off the mark, but I feel like Dexter, the series, sort of raised the bar for what <span class=Keyword>cable television writing</span> and storytelling could look like. I'm going to go ahead and believe that's true and I'm going to go ahead and be proud to have been a part of it. I hope they have better TV for it.</p> <p>How do you feel about saying goodbye to the character? <span class=Person>Hall</span>: I feel good about it. If you play a <span class=Keyword>character</span> long enough as an actor, your <span class=Keyword>sense</span> of acting and your <span class=Keyword>sense</span> of playing that specific <span class=Keyword>character</span> become fused in a <span class=Keyword>way</span> that it's sort of a mind bender so I'm glad to sort of disengage from this particular guy and move on to other things.</p>","TV Guide - Dexter: Michael C.
